## Summary

There were five heroes who stood against the primordial evil, Erebos, which had driven the world to the brink of destructionâ€”the Brave Hero Aaron, the Divine Blacksmith Dweno, the Nebula Pioneer Luna, the Wise Queen Lysinas, and lastly, me, the Hero of the Beginning, Kyle.

After reincarnating, everyone was praised as a Great Hero.

"Except for me."

A hero academy where the Hero Record, a divine gift that records the achievements of heroes, exists. I'll enroll there and find out the reason why.

"Well, might as well become an honors student while I'm at it."
