## Summary

Back in the Age of Despair, Kyle defeated Erebos, the genesis of evil. 5000 years later, he reincarnates as Leo with the memories of his past life intact.

His comrades - the Brave Hero Aaron, the Divine Blacksmith Dweno, the Nebula Pioneer Luna, and the Wise Queen Lysinas - were all heralded as great heroes.

However, the 'Hero Record', a gift from the heavens that records the achievements of heroes through the ages, had no record of Kyle whatsoever, and the people of the present treat him like a fictional character.

Angry about the reality he's found himself in, Leo enrolls at Lumene Academy, the hero academy which houses the Hero Record.

"Fine. I guess I'll become an honors student to figure out why I was written out of history."
