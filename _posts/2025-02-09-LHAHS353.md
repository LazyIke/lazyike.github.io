The Comet Sanctum stood at the heart of Seiren, but its significance extended far beyond its location. It was the resting place of the countless magical legacies left behind by the Comet Mage and the repository of Seiren's accumulated history.  

Ordinarily, access to this place was restricted, not just to outsiders but even to Seiren's own students. But today, in honor of the Magic Conference, the doors had been opened.  

The visiting mages who had come to attend the conference could barely contain their excitement.  

"The Comet Sanctum..."  

"To think I would witness the magical legacy of the Comet Mage with my own eyes."  

Five thousand years ago, after the Nebula Pioneer Luna, the Comet Mage was regarded as the greatest mage in history. She was not just an elven icon. Just as Luna was revered by all mages, so too was Seiren—Luna's successor, who reinterpreted Luna's magic and passed it down to later generations.  

"The decision to open the Comet Sanctum for the duration of the conference was made through the generosity of Acting Headmaster Lehagen," Orlen addressed the gathered scholars. "Seiren's students will serve as guides throughout your visit. I hope this will be a time for you to appreciate the true value of the Comet Mage's legacy."  

At his words, the attending mages exchanged surprised glances. It was well known that Lehagen, the acting headmaster of Seiren, was an elven supremacist. For him to open Seiren's archives to foreign scholars was... highly unexpected.  

Soon, groups of Seiren students were assigned to accompany the visitors. In truth, their role was not just that of guides—they were also meant to keep an eye on the guests, ensuring they did nothing improper.  

"Hello. I'll be your guide. My name is Eiran Ersar," a soft voice greeted Leo and Assistant Professor Anna.  

Eiran Ersar. Hearing the name, Assistant Professor Anna grew thoughtful. 

*I've heard she's an outstanding magic swordswoman.* 

As the second-year runner-up at Seiren, she had naturally drawn interest.  

*She had quite the impressive performance at last year's Lumeiren Games, too. If I recall, Professor Harrid mentioned that Leo has quite the history with her...*  

"Le-Leo," Eiran stammered, blushing as she hesitated. "It's an honor to guide you today."  

Assistant Professor Anna covered her mouth. *Oh my. How adorable.* 

Even at a glance, it was obvious that Eiran had feelings for Leo.  

Leo, oblivious, simply nodded. "I'll be in your care."  

"Yes!" Beaming, Eiran turned and led the way. "Where would you like to start?"  

"I'd like to see the original magic books left behind by the Comet Mage."  

"Understood! I'll guide you to the library!"  

With that, Eiran took the lead, and Leo and Assistant Professor Anna followed. As they walked, Anna tapped Leo's arm.  

"Aren't you lucky, Leo? Experiencing such a youthful school life."  

Leo gave her a look. "What are you talking about?"  

Anna smirked. "Eiran seems to like you."  

Leo's brows furrowed in confusion.  

"Isn't it every young man's dream?" she teased. "A beautiful girl, full of youthful admiration, harboring feelings for him. It's the essence of youth."  

"You're speaking as if you're not part of it."  

"I'm past my school days," Anna replied with a laugh. "Now, tell me. You're quite popular with the girls at Lumene too, aren't you? I heard you receive as many love letters as Abad and Duran, the most popular second-year students."  

*L-Love letters?!* Up ahead, Eiran's ears twitched.  

"You're well-liked among underclassmen. And even your seniors seem interested in you," Anna continued, nudging his side with a knowing smile. "Surely, you've dated at least once?"  

*D-Dating?!* Eiran's face flushed bright red.  

Anna chuckled at her reaction. "Elven ladies are so innocent. Getting so flustered over a little romance."  

*...That's not the only thing running through her mind right now.* Suppressing a laugh, Leo responded, "I've been too busy studying to think about dating."  

Anna pouted. "What a boring answer. That's something only a model student would say."  

Eiran, meanwhile, let out a quiet sigh of relief.  

"With so many beautiful girls around, I'd expect a teenage boy like you to have some interest," Anna mused.  

"If I were to date a student, I'd feel like I was committing a crime."  

"A crime?"  

Anna blinked, confused, but Leo simply smiled.  

Still flustered, Eiran kept her focus on leading them through the library's towering shelves. "This is the library where Seiren's magic books are stored."  

"As expected of Seiren," Anna murmured in admiration. For a mage, standing before records written by one of the legendary Heroes of Dawn was an honor beyond words.  

"Do you have any questions, Assistant Professor Anna?" Eiran asked politely.  

Anna smiled. "No, but why don't you go join Leo?"  

"...Huh?"  

Before Eiran could protest, Anna gave her a firm push toward Leo, who was browsing the shelves. Watching her stumble toward him, Anna chuckled to herself.  

"Ah, youth. I had my time, too," she mused, then sighed. "Now, I'm just a slave to that damn professor..."  

She grimaced, thinking of Len.  

Just then, someone hesitantly approached her. "Excuse me... Are you Assistant Professor Anna from Lumene?"  

Anna turned, mildly surprised. *Seiren's first-year students?*  

It wasn't just the visiting scholars who had been granted permission to explore the Comet Sanctum—Seiren's own students were also given access, guided by assigned groups. Naturally, this included the first-year lower-class students.  

A young girl at the front bowed. "My name is Angel Bizan."  

When she looked up, her expression was bright. "Leo told us to thank you if we ever had the chance to meet you."  

Anna blinked at the warm smile on Angel's face. *Ah, so these are the students Leo has been teaching.*

The lower-class students, having greatly improved through Introduction to Stellar Magic, stood before Anna. As she recalled the names listed in the documents Leo had given her, she nodded in recognition and smiled.  

"There's no need to thank me," she said. "I simply pointed you in the right direction. The ones who paved the path and achieved results were you."  

Angel shook her head. "But before this, all we had was despair. That's why we wanted to express our gratitude. Here..."  

She handed Anna a small paper box. Inside were letters—not just for Anna but for Len as well—filled with heartfelt messages of appreciation from students who had never even met him. They were addressed to the faculty of Lumene, who had given them a chance.  

Holding the box, Anna felt her chest tighten.  

"There's no guarantee we'll be able to stay at Seiren," Angel admitted, her smile unwavering, "but we have no regrets."  

Anna gently patted her shoulder. "Don't worry. Nothing bad will happen to you. And even if something does, once Professor Len reads these letters, he'll make sure to help you."  

For Len, these students were invaluable assets—proof of his research's new possibilities.  

*He might even start making a scene about enrolling them at Lumene.*  

Taking a deep breath, Anna steadied herself. *This conference carries a lot of weight.*  

Depending on whether Introduction to Stellar Magic was deemed heresy or innovation by the elven scholars, it would have a massive impact on the future of the magical world.  

*I need to stay focused.*  

Leo, who had been quietly walking through the library, suddenly stopped. Reaching out, he pulled a magic book from the shelf.  

Eiran, watching from behind, tilted her head. "Most of the records here are from when Seiren first started learning magic. Hardly anyone looks at them anymore. I didn't expect you to be interested, Leo."  

Leo glanced at her. "Most modern mages rely on later records when trying to understand a mage's philosophy."  

After all, it was easier to grasp someone's magical tendencies by studying records made after their worldview was already established.  

"But I'm an old-fashioned mage," he added with a smirk. "Just as the beginning is crucial, I believe that a mage's earliest records shape their beliefs."  

Eiran's eyes gleamed with curiosity. "You really do sound like an adult, Leo. But... how far back are we talking?"  

*Five thousand years.*  

Leo chuckled internally but didn't say it aloud. Instead, he flipped through the records Seiren had left behind in her teenage years.  

In truth, the magical academia of the elves paid little attention to the Comet Mage's early records. Most scholars focused on her greatest achievement—her reinterpretation of Stellar Magic. Even after three thousand years, her insights into Stellar Magic had yet to be fully deciphered.  

But Leo wasn't interested in Seiren as a scholar of Stellar Magic.  

What intrigued him more was Seiren before Luna's influence. The Seiren who had existed purely on her own.  

As he read, Leo clicked his tongue. *I should've expected this.*  

The records, written in Seiren's own words, were audacious—downright arrogant.  

Leo recalled how she had referred to him as a "love idiot." He gritted his teeth.  

It was fortunate she had explicitly stated that only her direct descendants should read her journal.  

Otherwise, he would have been immortalized in history as someone who had been hopelessly in love with Luna.  

*If that had happened, I would have strangled her the moment I met her.*  

Scowling at an ancestor he had never even seen, Leo refocused on the book.  

Despite his identity as an all-class, he was still a mage.  

A mage's personal writings were an invaluable window into their thoughts.  

*She was reckless. Completely fearless.*  

The records overflowed with confidence in her own magical principles.  

Even without additional notes, her personality bled through the interpretations of her magic.  

*She's exactly like Luna.*  

The arrogance of youth was evident, yet it was tempered by unwavering self-belief.  

*If she had met Luna back then, they would've fought nonstop.*  

Leo let out a quiet chuckle.  

*And then, they'd have become the best of friends.*  

Placing the book back on the shelf, he exhaled.  

*No wonder she left behind the phrase 'Believe in yourself' as a guiding principle.*  

He felt like he understood Seiren a little better.  

*But why did she write such blatant lies in her records? If you're going to write fiction, at least make it believable.*  

Seiren had conquered Luna's world.  

That meant she had to have understood Luna's emotions, at least to some extent.  

"Eiran."  

"Yes?"  

"What if the Nebula Pioneer had feelings for the Hero of the Beginning?"  

Eiran frowned. "...I can't even imagine that."  

For someone who enjoyed indulging in wild fantasies, her reaction was surprisingly firm.  

"It's just... picturing the noble Luna falling in love with someone is beyond me."  

"Then what if it was the Hero of the Beginning who liked the Nebula Pioneer?"  

"A tragic love story? That's wonderful!"  

*...These damned elves always interpret things however they please.*  

Leo clenched his jaw.  

In the end, Seiren had written a glorified romance novel and left it for future generations.  

*When I meet her, I'm kicking her.*

The tour of the Comet Sanctum concluded.  

As the conference prepared to begin, Acting Headmaster Lehagen stepped forward.  

"I extend my gratitude to the honored guests who have graced this occasion," he said impassively.  

He stood at the center of the Comet Sanctum, and behind him, atop a pedestal, rested *Cometes*, the mage staff that symbolized the Comet Mage.  

The assembled mages murmured in awe at seeing Cometes in person.  

"I trust that, through the Comet Sanctum, you have once again come to appreciate the greatness of Seiren."  

As Lehagen continued, the scholars merely exchanged knowing looks.  

*Of course.*  

No one openly voiced their objections. It would be exhausting to argue, and besides, the Comet Mage's achievements were undeniable.  

Every mage already understood her brilliance—there was no need for constant reminders.  

"And with that in mind, before the conference officially begins, Seiren has an announcement to make."  

Lehagen's words drew puzzled expressions from the audience.  

"A great discovery has been made," he declared. "Today, I officially announce the recovery of Seiren's Hero Record."  

A murmur spread through the gathered mages.  

Even the attending Seiren students, who had come merely to observe, widened their eyes in shock.  

Amidst the murmuring, Orlen strode onto the stage, carrying an ornate wooden box.  

Lehagen smirked. *If I am the one to first announce the discovery of Seiren's Hero Record, securing my position as Seiren's headmaster will be inevitable.*  

For now, he was merely the acting principal, but if the Pureblood Society continued to strengthen its hold, he would officially assume the role.  

With a click, the box was opened, revealing a fragment of the Hero Record.

"This," Lehagen proclaimed, "is none other than the Hero Record of the Comet Mage, Seiren..."  

A deep hum echoed through the air.  

For a brief moment, Lehagen hesitated.  

*This reaction... Could it be opening a Hero World?*  

But before he could fully process the thought, he noticed something.  

Across the room, Leo had risen to his feet, his expression hardening.  

"Leo?" Anna asked, confused.  

Then—  

*FWOOOOOOSH—!*

Black flames erupted from Seiren's Hero Record.
