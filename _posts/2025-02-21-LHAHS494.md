Chen Xia took a deep breath. Countless monster corpses were piled up around her, but the seemingly endless waves of monsters had stopped at some point.

Realizing that the presence of monsters in the vicinity had completely vanished, Chen Xia asked, "Eiran, are you okay?"

"Yes! I'm perfectly fine! What about you, Chen Xia?" Eiran replied energetically.

Chen Xia smiled. "I'm fine too."

After replying, Chen Xia looked down at her palm.

*Sure enough, Sir Aaron's training had an effect.*

Her movements had become noticeably sharper. She could also react to enemy attacks much more swiftly.

Marveling at the results of her training, Chen Xia said, "Come on, let's hurry and catch up to Sir Leo."

"Yes!"

Eiran followed behind Chen Xia, and they tracked the traces Leo had left behind.

Chen Xia asked, "Come to think of it, Eiran, earlier, you mentioned that Lady Luna was laid to rest here, right?"

"Huh?" Eiran flinched in surprise.

Watching Eiran's reaction, Chen Xia smiled. "The resting places of the Great Heroes have never been made public. But Sir Leo and you spoke as if you knew for certain that Lady Luna was buried here. How did you know?"

"Uh, well, that is..."

"You share a secret with Sir Leo, don't you?" Chen Xia asked her sharp question with a smile.

Eiran grew flustered, unsure of what to do.

At that moment, Leo's voice came from the other side. "You're safe."

"Ah! Sir Leo! You're safe too... huh?" Eiran turned to Leo with a bright expression—only to freeze.

Chen Xia, too, stiffened as she saw the woman standing beside Leo.

There stood a very familiar figure.

Eiran and Chen Xia gaped in shock.

"L-Lady Luna?" Chen Xia cautiously asked.

"Hm? You know me?" Luna tilted her head in confusion.

*Thud—*

Eiran was so shocked that her legs gave in and she collapsed onto the ground.

Seeing that, Luna crouched down next to Eiran, tilted her head and asked, "Hey, are you okay? Are you hurt?"

Watching her, Chen Xia urgently questioned Leo. "Sir Leo! Why is Lady Luna here in the present world?"

"It's the same situation as when Aaron was here before," Leo replied calmly.

Chen Xia was speechless.

"L-Lady Luna." Eiran gazed at Luna with an emotional expression.

Luna turned to Leo. "Kyle, why is she acting like this?"

Unaware of her own status in the currently era, she was thoroughly confused.

"Kyle?" Chen Xia's face was once again filled with confusion.

Letting out a sigh, Leo said, "For now, let's return to the village. We can sort everything out after that."

"Why did Lady Luna call you Kyle, Sir Leo? She meant the Hero of the Beginning, Sir Kyle, didn't she?" Chen Xia asked with a serious expression.

Looking at her silently for a moment, Leo let out a small sigh. "I suppose there's no point in hiding it anymore."

Hearing that, Chen Xia tensed slightly.

"Actually... I'm the Hero of the Beginning, Kyle," Leo admitted hesitantly.

"What?"

"I was reincarnated."

Chen Xia looked dazed. Her expression showed that she was struggling to comprehend what she had just heard.

Then, suddenly realizing the truth, she sprang to her feet in shock. 

"You're the Hero of the Beginning, Sir Kyle?!"

Leo nodded.

Chen Xia sat down heavily, lost in thought.

After replaying Leo's past actions in her mind, she let out a hollow laugh. "I did think you were unusual ever since enrollment."

His constant connection to the Great Heroes and his absurd growth speed. It was an unbelievable claim, yet if he was truly the Hero of the Beginning, Kyle, then it all made sense.

*Even his overly mature demeanor.*

Shaking her head, Chen Xia soon made a sulky expression. "Aside from me, who else knows your true identity?"

"The Dragon Queen Melina, Chelsea, and Eiran, I suppose."

*The Emperor of Xian seems to have vaguely caught on as well.*

As Leo thought of Xian's emperor, Syau, his eyes narrowed slightly.

"The Dragon Queen Melina, I can understand... but you told Chelsea and Eiran but not me? That's a little hurtful."

"I never planned to tell anyone aside from Melina in the first place." Leo sighed. "Aaron was the one who spilled the secret to Chelsea first, and Eiran overheard our conversation when Chelsea came to question me about it."

"I see." Chen Xia, narrowing her eyes, quietly took her seat again.

Watching her, Luna smiled brightly and clapped her hands together. "Now that we've sorted that out, let's introduce ourselves. My name is Luna Luminance."

Chen Xia followed. "My name is Chen Xia."

"Nice to meet you. And you?"

"I'm Eiran Ersar."

"Ersar?" Luna froze for a moment.

Eiran, noticing her reaction, smiled shyly. "I'm a descendant of Velkia."

"Oh my!" Luna's face lit up. "So Velkia got married after all? I was a little worried since she had such strange taste in books!"

Luna stepped forward and held Eiran's face, examining her closely. "Now that I look closely, you do resemble Velkia a bit!"

"Not at all. Velkia was arrogant, but Eiran's adorable," Leo remarked dryly. "Also, Xia is Bihar's descendant."

"Oh my! Is that so?" Luna's face brightened again. "I see. So they lived in a peaceful world and left behind descendants. I'm glad."

Luna smiled with relief.

Eiran and Chen Xia stared at her, slightly mesmerized.

"Alright. Eiran, right? Velkia was like a daughter to me. So don't be shy—treat me like an older sister."

"More like a grandmother," Leo remarked snidely.

Luna scowled and kicked at him, but Leo, familiar with her antics, dodged effortlessly.

Watching their easygoing interaction, Chen Xia chuckled. "So the Great Heroes were like this. They don't seem all that different from us—it's kind of fascinating."

She was reminded of the friendly bickering among her classmates.

*Sir Leo's never been this casual before.*

Resting her chin on her hand, Chen Xia watched Leo and Luna.

*Well, he is the Hero of the Beginning. One of the five people in history who fought with the fate of the world at stake.*

In a way, Luna was one of the only four people who could stand as Leo's equal.

As she watched them banter, Chen Xia tilted her head and asked, "By the way, what do we do now? It's great that Lady Luna has returned to the present like Sir Aaron... but what should we do next?"

Luna raised her hand. "I know! There's something I really want to do."

"What is it?" Leo gave her a puzzled look.

"I want to visit Lumene Academy."

The week-long field training period had come to an end, and right on schedule, the second-year students began returning one by one to Lumene Academy. Of course, some students were on long-term missions and had yet to return, but supplementary lessons for them were already planned.

"I'm back!"

*Bang—!*

Eliana burst through the dormitory door, dashed straight into the lounge, and flung herself onto the sofa.

*Thud—!*

"As expected, the lounge sofa is the best! Mm~ this comfort!" Stretching her arms, Eliana basked in the cozy feeling of the sofa.

"Welcome back, Eliana."

"Hi, Xia!" Waving brightly at Chen Xia, Eliana suddenly noticed something and her eyes widened. "Eiran? Seiren's Eiran?"

Eliana shot up from her seat, her face filled with surprise. "Why are you wearing our school uniform?"

"I'm here as an exchange student to study at Lumene for a while."

"Aha! I see!" Eliana nodded in understanding and turned to the side. "And this person is...?"

Another elf was also dressed in a Lumene uniform.

"My name is Lu. I'm also here as an exchange student. Nice to meet you."

"Oh? Lu? That name's new to me."

Although they were from different schools, Eliana had interacted with Seiren's second-years a few times and was familiar with the names of the more outstanding students of her generation. However, she had never heard of a student named Lu.

"Lu... Lu is from the lower class, so that might be why."

"Ohh, I see. Lower class." Crossing her arms, Eliana nodded sagely. Then, with a bright smile, she said, "My name is Eliana Raden! Looking forward to our time together!"

"Likewise."

"But you do look really familiar." Eliana narrowed her eyes as she studied Lu carefully, stroking her chin.

"I hear that a lot."

"Oh, I see!" Eliana readily accepted the reply.

Lu, no, Luna watched her with a smile.

The reason Eliana didn't recognize Luna was simple. Luna was using a perception-dampening spell. Because of the magic's effects, Eliana couldn't fully recognize Luna and simply thought she had a familiar face.

*Only Luna could pull something like this off.*

A mage of equal or greater skill than the caster might have been able to see through the spell, but there was no mage in this world greater than Luna.

*Melina had a rough few days.*

Upon hearing about Luna, Melina had been busy for several days creating a false identity. And so, the second-year Seiren student named Lu—someone even Seiren didn't know—came into existence.

Fortunately, it wasn't like Lumene would bother verifying such minor details with Seiren. Though the two schools had interactions, they didn't share information on such trivial matters.

As Luna chatted cheerfully with the students of Glory, Leo smirked.

"Leo."

"You're here? Chloe."

"Yeah. I heard something about exchange students." Chloe tilted her head in curiosity, and Leo pointed at Luna and Eiran.

"Eiran, I see. And the other one..." Chloe marveled. "She's really pretty. Was there such a student in Seiren?"

"She's from the lower class."

"I see." Chloe nodded in understanding.

Meanwhile, Luna was still laughing and talking with the Glory students.

"She's quite sociable," Chen Xia remarked in admiration.

Leo chuckled. "She's always been good at making friends." 

As he looked at Luna, Leo thought to himself, *I hope she enjoys this.*

That afternoon, the second-year classes resumed. The first class on the schedule was none other than Magic Studies. The second-year magic students gathered in the large lecture hall, and upon seeing the massive chalkboard filled with magic formulas, they were at a loss for words.

"What the hell is that?"

"Is this some kind of alien language?"

"Wait, is this even a magic formula in the first place?"

The Magic Studies students murmured among themselves. 

Chloe, however, stared at the bizarre spell formations with shining eyes. Her blue eyes quickly scanned the magic formulas.

"Fufufu, welcome, students." Len smirked proudly as he looked over the seated students. "While you were out on field training, I came up with a rather interesting idea, so I tried to turn it into a spell formula. Does anyone have a guess as to what kind of magic this is?"

All eyes turned to Chloe. Abad and Chelsea had yet to return from their field missions, but even if they had been present, the students would have still looked to Chloe. Among the second-year magic students, it was common knowledge that when it came to magic theory, Chloe was the best.

Under everyone's gaze, Chloe said, "It seems to be a spell related to time."

"Excellent! Outstanding! As expected of Chloe!" Len clapped his hands in delight. "Now! Let me explain this magic in detail..."

"Professor, I think there's a miscalculation in the formula," someone interrupted, raising a hand.

Len's eyes bulged as he turned toward the voice.

There, Luna sat, her eyes gleaming with excitement.
