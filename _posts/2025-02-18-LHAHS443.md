"It seems Vanir has realized Sir Aaron's identity," Melina said with a slightly troubled expression.

Leo remained calm. "He probably expected as much."

"What should we do?"

"I doubt those three will spread the word."

All three of them were former student council presidents. They understood the kind of shockwaves it would send if news of Aaron's presence in this era were to spread.

"Even so, I'll speak with them just in case," Melina sighed.

"Alright." Leo nodded, his gaze shifting to Aaron, who was instructing the graduates.

*So you're making your own preparations.*

"And Leo."

"What?"

"About what you mentioned before. I think next week should be fine."

Leo nodded. "Got it."

The third week of the training camp.

*Splash—*

"Ahh, this is heaven~"

"I've been waiting for this moment~"

By now, the second-years had fully adapted to life at the campsite, successfully managing all their basic needs.

"Who would've thought we'd even build a bathhouse?"

"I think it's great. Even Celia was happy about it."

Chen Xia responded with a smile. "That's true."

No matter how much they were hero candidates, they were still teenagers. Even in extreme environments, there were plenty of students who cared about their appearance.

As a result, even while surviving in the wild, the students' desire to stay clean had only grown. Eventually, that led them to build a bathhouse.

As they soaked in the hot water, washing away the fatigue of the day...

"Those damn first-years! Huh?! We seniors are suffering like hell, and they're just lounging around, living comfortably?!"

A sharp voice rang out as Eliana stormed into the bathhouse, grabbing Nella and ranting.

"I felt bad, thinking the first-years were struggling like us! But this betrayal—what am I supposed to do with this?!"

"You really want to take out your frustration on your juniors for that reason?" Nella shook her head.

Yesterday, it had been revealed that while the second-years had been thrown into the wild and forced to endure hellish days, the first-years had been training in a very comfortable environment.

"I wanted to sit around a campfire too! Eat delicious food every day! Stay up late having fun! That's the training camp I dreamed of! I wanted to sit by the fire and reflect on my parents' love like a good daughter!" Eliana flailed her arms, practically wailing.

The Lumene girls turned away from her.

Grumbling to herself, she sank into the hot springs.

"By the way, this is an open-air bath, but no one's trying to peek. Where are all the perverts?"

"Do you think anyone would be stupid enough to try that?"

It was obvious. With so many prodigies in aura, magic, and summoning gathered here, sneaking past the girls' senses was impossible. It would be a literal suicide mission.

At that, Eliana spoke up. "Why? The class rep has the skills for it, doesn't he?"

"Leo would never do something like that."

"He is still a guy, though," she muttered under her breath, but no one agreed with her.

"Even idiotic thoughts have their limits," Chelsea scolded.

Eliana pursed her lips, then smirked.

Chelsea narrowed her eyes. "What's with that nasty grin?" 

Eliana quickly shook her head. "No, it's just... You're definitely still a kid. Compared to someone else, that is."

Her gaze shifted to Chen Xia. "Xia is a proper older sister… Mhmm! Kuhak! Gurgle!"

Before she could finish, Chelsea swiftly kicked her, sending her flailing.

After a brief commotion...

"Oh! By the way, did you hear?"

"Hear what?"

"There's no training tomorrow!"

"What do you mean?"

At Eliana's sudden announcement, everyone's eyes widened.

"Tomorrow is a free day! We can go into Dellan, the capital of the Dellad Kingdom! We just have to return the day after tomorrow!"

"What?!"

"Seriously?!"

"You're not lying, right?"

The girls' eyes sparkled as they gathered around Eliana.

"Of course not~ Carl told me, so it's legit!"

"We're finally free from this hell!"

"It's only for a day, but we can finally relax!"

"Hooray!"

The next morning, during morning roll call, Melina appeared.

"You have all worked hard over the past three weeks, enduring intense training. You have done well to push through such a grueling schedule. So, for the next two days, you are all permitted to..."

"Wooohooo! We're free!"

"Anyone who just screamed, step forward. Now," Raynia said icily.

The students who had cheered instantly turned pale.

As a few unfortunate students received punishment, Melina smiled warmly and concluded, "I hope you all enjoy your time off."

Aaron's eyes widened at the sight before him. The place where he now stood was none other than the streets of Dellan.

"So this is what a city of the present era looks like," he marveled.

Though it was the capital of a small, remote kingdom, the streets bustled with life. As he watched the passing carriages and pedestrians, Aaron kept turning his head from side to side, taking everything in.

Watching him, Chelsea muttered, "Doesn't Sir Aaron make you a little anxious?"

"What do you mean?"

"I feel like I have to keep an eye on him. It's like watching a child near a riverbank."

Carl snickered. "Coming from you, the most childish of us all, that's hilarious."

Without hesitation, Chelsea delivered a dropkick to Carl's side.

Groaning in pain, Carl clutched his ribs and writhed on the ground before finally managing to sit up. "Anyway, Leo and Chelsea, the Dragon Queen entrusted you two with guiding Sir Aaron, right?"

"Yep!" Chelsea puffed out her chest proudly. For a hero candidate, personally guiding a Great Hero, someone they had only read about in childhood fairy tales, was an honor beyond measure.

"Aru was practically in tears when Lunia dragged her away," Carl added.

Aru had volunteered to be Aaron's guide but was rejected. Melina had reasoned that Aaron, who was subtly wary of Aru, might not be able to fully enjoy his time if she was around.

"Still, we'll be staying at the same inn tonight."

Chelsea and Carl shook their heads, thinking of Aru.

"What about you, Carl? What are you planning to do?"

"Hmph. I'm going to find some rare goods to sneak back in. I'll make a fortune."

"If you get caught, it's going to be a disaster."

"I just have to not get caught." Carl grinned.

Chelsea shook her head at him. "You're saying this right in front of Leo."

As student council president, Leo had reported Carl to the student council multiple times for his clever ways of bending the rules.

"As long as it's nothing too serious, he said he'd overlook minor contraband. Hehehe!" Carl laughed confidently.

"Good luck with that."

"Alright then, have a great time! Sir Aaron! See you in the evening!" Carl waved as he left.

Aaron waved back before turning to Chelsea. "Chelsea, I'll buy that for you. Let's eat together."

He pointed to an ice cream stand.

"Yes, Sir Aaron!"

Lunchtime, following Leo's recommendation, the three of them arrived at a hidden gem of a restaurant in Dellan. It wasn't a luxurious establishment, but since Leo had lived in Dellan, they could trust his judgment. And sure enough, the food was outstanding.

"Phew." Sitting on a bench near the restaurant, Chelsea muttered as she basked in the bright summer sun. "This is bliss. This is what life should be."

After spending three weeks stuck in the mountains, this moment of relaxation was utter paradise.

As she grinned contentedly, Aaron approached. "Chelsea, the sun is strong. You'll get sunburned. I bought you a hat."

"Thank you!"

"I also got some drinks. Let's have them as dessert."

"Yes!"

Chelsea put on the wide-brimmed hat Aaron handed her and took a sip of the cold, ice-filled drink. She smiled—then suddenly gasped, her eyes widening as she shot to her feet.

"Wait! This isn't right!"

Aaron, who had just brought his straw to his lips, blinked in surprise.

Leo frowned. "What's not right?"

"Leo, you're helping guide Sir Aaron around the city! But what about me? Sir Aaron has been taking care of me this whole time, when I'm supposed to be the one guiding him!"

Since arriving in the city, Leo had taken the lead as Aaron's guide. The entire reason this free day had been arranged was so that Aaron could experience the present era.

Aaron had initially refused, insisting that his time should be spent helping the next generation grow, but Leo had forced him to take the day off.

Yet now, instead of sightseeing, Aaron was looking after Chelsea like a doting older brother.

For Chelsea, who had been thrilled about guiding a Great Hero, the situation was completely unexpected.

"But I like this."

"Huh?"

"Don't get me wrong, I really like Aru, Lunia, Eiran, Drianna, Carl, and Velkia."

To Aaron, Velkia had been both a younger sibling and a student. A disciple who stood alongside him on the battlefield. A cherished younger sibling whom he had helped and been helped by countless times.

"But you, Chelsea, remind me of my younger siblings from my childhood."

"Your younger siblings...?"

"Yes." Aaron's smile turned slightly wistful. "The siblings I failed to protect because of my own foolishness."

The children from the orphanage. Children far too young to face death.

"If I hadn't been so stupid back then... maybe they would have grown up and seen this blue sky for themselves." Aaron looked up at the sky. "That's why I want to take care of you. Does that bother you?"

Chelsea awkwardly shifted her gaze. "No... It's just... I don't know how to react. My older brother and Leo are affectionate in their own way, but neither of them has ever taken care of me like this. It feels unfamiliar... but also kind of nice."

Aaron chuckled. "Then just spend time with me."

"Yes! But if you only take care of me like this, won't Leo feel a little left out?"

Chelsea glanced at Leo, prompting Aaron to smirk.

"Leo wouldn't mind. Right?"

"Don't worry about me."

"See?"

At Leo's response, Chelsea nodded. "Then shall we get moving?"

"In that case, I'd like to visit the library next," Aaron said.

Leo nodded.

*Leo really is amazing.*

Watching them, Chelsea let out a laugh.

At first, she had been surprised at how easily Leo conversed with Aaron.

*Carl and the others said Leo spoke as an equal to the Great Heroes in the Hero World, right?*

Every time she heard those stories, she found them astonishing, yet at the same time, they suited Leo perfectly.

*Even Sir Aaron seems more relaxed around Leo. Maybe that's part of Leo's charm.*

Chelsea smiled as she watched the two walk ahead… when she suddenly paused.

Aaron, talking with Leo... Something about it felt oddly familiar.

*Where have I seen this before?*

Tilting her head, Chelsea tried to recall.

Then, something clicked in her mind.

Aaron's demeanor reminded her of herself—the way she relied on Leo as an older sibling.

*Wait...*

Chelsea's expression went blank as a strange sense of confusion and bewilderment settled over her.

"Huh?"
