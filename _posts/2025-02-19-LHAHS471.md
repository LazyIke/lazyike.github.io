*Kwaaang—! Kwajik—!*

Lily's battle hammer shattered Joren's battle axe into pieces.

"...?!" Joren's face contorted in shock.

*Thwack—! Crunch—!*

"Guhhk!" Hit squarely by the hammer, Joren collapsed to the ground. 

Lily rushed forward and raised her hammer once more.

"W-Wait! You call yourself someone who aspires to be a hero, yet you're about to mercilessly…!"

"Shut up!"

*Crack—!*

Lily's hammer crushed Joren's skull without hesitation.

"Huff, huff..." Lily panted heavily, retrieving her battle hammer.

*Thud—*

She slumped to the ground, breathing raggedly, as Leo approached and extended a hand.

"As expected, Senior Lily, you're incredible."

"Haa... Haa... Didn't you take down four of them in an instant, Leo?"

With trembling fingers, Lily grasped Leo's hand and pulled herself up.

"Huuh. Huuh." Taking deep breaths to calm herself, Lily added, "And I had a lot of help from you. I still have a long way to go."

In her battle with Joren, Leo had simply stood back and watched, but Joren, who had witnessed Leo effortlessly disposing of four Justice Guild members as if they were insects, had already lost his composure. The moment Leo had stepped in, everything would have been over. That pressure alone had shaken Joren's concentration.

"Regardless, the fact remains that you took down someone clearly stronger than you."

No matter how skilled Lily was, she was still just a third-year at Lumene. Meanwhile, her opponent had studied up to the fifth year at Lumene. Not only that, but he had never neglected his training, determined to become a hero. Defeating such an opponent was a testament to Lily's strength.

*Even if I weren't here, Lily would have won.*

While it was true that Leo's presence had pressured Joren, Lily's combat prowess was far beyond expectations. She had pushed herself beyond her limits.

*A clear sign of a hero's potential.*

As Leo silently evaluated her, Lily gazed at the battlefield with a complex expression. "It's shocking that there were people in the Justice Guild with such beliefs."

A mindset that viewed others as mere sacrifices to become a hero. For Lily, it was utterly unacceptable.

"This isn't just their personal ideology."

"Of course. There must be lunatics higher up feeding them such delusions. I'd love to crack their skulls open and examine their brains to see how they came up with such madness."

"......" Leo stared at Lily. 

Realizing what she had just said, Lily clamped her mouth shut and coughed. "Ahem, I got a bit carried away. I tend to be a bit foul-mouthed when I'm drunk."

"A bit? That was more than a bit."

"Just think of it as drunken rambling."

Leo nodded as Lily shamelessly played it off.

At that moment, Viscount Esimon, who had previously withdrawn with the troops, approached. "Sir Leo, Lady Lily."

"Viscount Esimon, are the soldiers safe?"

"Yes, thanks to you two, all the soldiers are unharmed. Truly, I have no idea how to repay this debt..."

"As Lumene students, we simply did what was expected of us. Think nothing of it!" Lily waved a hand dismissively.

"Regardless, thank you. However, there is someone who wishes to meet you."

At Viscount Esimon's cautious words, Lily tilted her head in curiosity.

*Looks like someone from higher up has arrived.*

Leo immediately grasped the situation. Viscount Esimon was the commander of this front. He wasn't someone of low rank. Yet, the fact that he was acting so reservedly...

*Did the King of Carnel send an envoy to us?*

As Leo had guessed, an aristocratic-looking man, stroking his goatee, was approaching them. He was clad in an ostentatious suit of armor that served no practical purpose and had no place on the battlefield.

*The war situation isn't great, yet if the central authority is sending someone dressed like that... this country must seriously be in shambles.*

Leo let out a dry chuckle. Lily also seemed to be thinking along the same lines, as her expression subtly tensed.

Whether or not he noticed their reactions, the noble loudly declared with a look of deep emotion, "I am Duke Kernbill Dotarn! Upon hearing that Lumene had sent Sir Leo Plov and Lady Lily Luce to aid our Carnel Kingdom, I rushed here at once!"

At those words, Lily corrected him. "That's not the case. We came here to investigate those desecrating the heroes' graves..."

"Now, now! That's a trivial matter, is it not?"

"A trivial matter?"

Lily's expression hardened. The heroes buried in this land were the very souls who had once fought to protect it. 

Even if they were figures from ancient history, even if they had lived before this kingdom was founded… To the people of this land, they were not to be taken lightly. To defile their graves was to mock their legacy.

She had taken on this mission partly out of personal interest but also to bring justice to those committing such disgraceful acts. 

Though her face grew devoid of expression, Duke Dotarn, oblivious, stroked his beard as he continued speaking excitedly, "Our Carnel Kingdom requires the salvation of great heroes! Those vile Petimen Kingdom scoundrels are oppressing us with the backing of the Justice Guild! Lumene should rightfully aid us, should it not? Anyway, this battlefield is hardly the place for such discussions. His Majesty wishes to meet with you to explain the kingdom's situation."

Leo glanced at Lily. They needed more information to fully grasp the situation. 

Lily gave a nod.

Leo replied, "Understood."

"Hahaha! The Petimen Kingdom is finished now!" As if he had secured Lumene's support, Duke Dotarn let out a boisterous laugh.

They were then transported to the royal palace via a temporary Warp Gate.

Upon arrival, they were greeted by a massive number of attendants and maids. The palace staff immediately ushered Leo and Lily into a dressing chamber.

"It is an honor to serve you. We shall prepare you at once."

"What are you doing? Why are you touching my clothes? H-Hey! Leo is right next to me..." Lily's flustered voice echoed, followed by the sound of curtains being drawn.

A commotion could be heard from inside.

"I'll take it off myself..."

"There's no time for that!"

"Then at least explain the situation!"

*Rustle— Rustle—*

Leo caught Lily's school uniform jacket as it was tossed out. It seemed the maids were forcibly dressing her.

*What kind of situation is this?*

Furrowing his brows, Leo found himself being swiftly measured by attendants who promptly dressed him in an elaborate formal suit.

"His Majesty has prepared a welcoming banquet in your honor," the chief chamberlain whispered into Leo's ear.

*Swish—!*

Shortly after, the curtains were drawn, and Lily stepped out in an elegant dress. 

She wobbled slightly, unfamiliar with high heels, and frowned. "This is uncomfortable. Give me back my shoes."

The maids firmly hid Lily's shoes behind them. "No! You look absolutely stunning, yet you want to wear these military boots?"

Letting out a deep sigh, Lily folded her arms and stood beside Leo. "You look good, Leo."

"You look beautiful too, Senior Lily."

"That was probably just courtesy, but... it still feels nice to hear." Lily smiled slightly.

Leo shook his head. He had meant what he said. Lily, dressed up, was truly stunning.

"What in the world is this nonsense? When I heard from Viscount Esimon, he made it sound like the entire kingdom was on the verge of collapse. Shouldn't they be having serious discussions about state affairs instead of hosting a welcoming banquet? And all this money wasted on expensive dresses and jewelry, wouldn't it be better spent providing supplies for the soldiers...?"

"They probably want to maintain formality while officially requesting help. High-ranking people love their pomp and ceremony," Leo said, calming Lily, who was getting riled up.

She took a deep breath. "That makes sense. Given how dire the situation is, we need to have a serious conversation and report back to the school."

Lily straightened her posture and puffed out her chest. She had returned to being the proud Lumene senior representative.

Leo adjusted his tie and stood beside her. The two were led to the banquet hall. 

Moments later, the grand doors swung open… and what lay before them was nothing short of sheer opulence.

The first thing that caught the eye was the fountain in the center of the hall where wine, instead of water, flowed. The food was an endless spread of luxurious delicacies, regardless of the season. The hall itself was adorned with lavish flowers, gemstones, and gold. A massive orchestra filled the room with music. The nobles attending the banquet were dressed so extravagantly that Leo and Lily's outfits seemed almost plain in comparison. 

On one side, nobles were even gambling. It was less of a welcoming banquet and more of a social gathering.

It was a spectacle of indulgence. Judging by the sheer number of nobles present, it seemed as if nearly the entire aristocracy of the kingdom had gathered.

For the first time, Lily's expression completely disappeared.

At that moment, the king ,seated at the highest place, pointed toward Leo and Lily. "Look upon them! My loyal subjects! The heroes who have come to save this nation have arrived! Welcome them with the highest honor!"

Thunderous cheers erupted from the nobles. From that alone, one could easily mistake this kingdom for a land of prosperity.

Leo let out a deep sigh.

"Leo."

"Yes?"

"The king of this country... No, the nobles of this country are all out of their fucking minds."

"I agree."

In the end, Leo and Lily were unable to have even a single conversation with the King of Carnel about the current situation. The king was too busy enjoying the banquet to pay them any attention.

Whenever they tried to approach, nobles blocked their path, engaging them in meaningless conversation. Realizing it was impossible to discuss anything of importance, Lily could only swallow her frustration.

Radiating an aura that told others to stay away, she stationed herself by the fountain and relentlessly downed wine.

After the banquet concluded, the two were led to their guest quarters.

Drunk, Lily, who had entered the room with Leo, erupted in fury, "This is insane! The soldiers are risking their lives for their country, and the ones who sent them to war are indulging in luxury and debauchery! They're out of their minds! The ones in charge have clearly lost it! Don't you think so, Leo?!"

*She's wasted.*

The usually composed Lily, who always treated her juniors with respect, had even dropped her formal speech.

"It's always like this."

"Of course it is! The world is filthy! But there should be a limit to how mad they can be!" Lily, overwhelmed with emotions, irritably pulled out her hair ornament. "I barely stopped myself from smashing their heads in!"

"We should be able to have a proper discussion tomorrow."

"And if they're still like that in the morning?"

"Then we'll have to take matters into our own hands. We can't just leave the Justice Guild unchecked."

No matter what, Leo intended to wipe out the Justice Guild entirely.

"Right." Lily nodded.

Leo looked at her and said, "For now, you should get some rest in your room. You've had a long day."

"Before that." Lily stepped toward Leo. She cupped his face with both hands and pulled him toward her. A distance close enough for their breaths to mix.

Leo groaned, "Senior, you're drunk."

"Yeah, and since I'm drunk, I'll just say it." With the heavy scent of alcohol on her breath, Lily's slightly unfocused eyes met his. "Leo Plov."

"Yes?"

"Take me as your disciple."

Leo let out a small laugh at the sudden request. "I'm your junior. How could I possibly take you as a disciple?"

"What does that matter?"

Returning to her usual tone, Lily walked over to the bed and plopped down, kicking off her crystal-lined heels and sending them flying across the room.

"One should learn from those more skilled than themselves."

"Have you always wanted to be my disciple?"

"No. If I had been a spirit beast summoner, maybe I would have thought about it. But I'm a spirit mage."

Publicly, Leo was known to be more skilled in spirit beast summoning than spirit magic.

"But after seeing your spirit magic earlier, I changed my mind."

Lily had witnessed Leo's ability during the battle.

"Your spirit magic was perfect."

*Of course. I was copying Lysinas.*

Wiggling her now freed toes, Lily got up and stepped closer to Leo. Looking up at him, she said, "It wouldn't feel right to just ask you to teach me spirit magic. That's why I'm making this request. A disciple does whatever their master tells them to. Whatever you need, just leave it to me. If you tell me to do assignments, I'll do assignments. If you tell me to buy bread, I'll buy bread."

"That's not a disciple, that's an errand runner."

"Either way." Lily smiled brightly. "I want to be your disciple. I'll serve you well as my master."

"I don't want to be the kind of shameless junior who exploits their senior."

Lily grabbed Leo's collar. "Take me as your disciple. You don't have a fucking choice."

Staring at the drunken, insistent Lily, Leo sighed and looked up at the ceiling.

*I'm definitely not drinking with her again.*

Soldiers of the Petimen Kingdom wielding shovels and pickaxes were digging up a hero's grave. The monument honoring the hero had already been destroyed, its fragments scattered across the ground.

Guilt was evident on the soldiers' faces.

"Stop dawdling and dig faster!" a supervising knight barked.

"Ah... To think we're desecrating this grave..."

"This hero sacrificed themselves for this land 3,000 years ago."

The soldiers let out pained sighs. A hero they had heard about since childhood. A hero whose tales were famous throughout the northeastern region.

The fact that they were defiling such a person's grave filled them with immense guilt.

"If you get caught talking, you'll be executed!" a senior soldier whispered harshly.

Moments later, a coffin emerged from the dug-up grave, and the supervisor pried the lid open.

*Crunch—!*

Only dust remained inside.

"This one is empty too." The knight sneered and yelled at the soldiers who were attempting to restore the grave even slightly. "What are you doing?!"

"Huh? Sir, shouldn't we at least try to put it back..."

"There's no time for that! Move on to the next grave!"

The soldiers silently offered their deepest apologies to the hero from 3,000 years ago as they left.

*Krrraaaack—!*

Moments later, thunder rumbled in the sky. Droplets fell—then a downpour followed, turning the disturbed grave into a muddy swamp.

*Crunch—!*

Suddenly, a hand burst through the muddy ground.

*Squelch— Squelch—*

A man, caked in dirt, slowly rose.

[Unforgivable...]

His dirt-covered eyes glowed a deep crimson.

[I will never forgive this...!]

A voice filled with hatred and resentment seeped from his lips.
