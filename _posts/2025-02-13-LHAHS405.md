"The World Summit?" Carl's eyes widened at Leo's words. 

Not just him—everyone at the dinner table reacted with surprise.

The World Summit.

As the name suggested, it was a gathering of the world's most powerful figures.

The first summit had taken place 3,000 years ago in none other than Dragonia. The one who had brought the world's leaders together back then was the Dawn Dragon, Rodia.

The reason for that summit's inception was the reappearance of Erebos, and the attendees of that first gathering had been those now known as the Heroes of Dawn—Lumene, Seiren, Azonia, Damien, and the heroes they led.

Since then, the summit had been held whenever the world faced a crisis. There were five main locations where the meetings could take place: Dragonia and the four major hero academies.

"Wow, a summit? So all the world's rulers are coming to Lumene?" Eliana clicked her tongue in disbelief.

"Most likely," Chloe replied. "Attendance isn't mandatory, but missing the summit means falling behind in global affairs. No ruler wants that, so they'll all try to be here."

"How do you even know this stuff?"

"Books." Chloe simply raised the book in her hands.

"The library's closed, though."

"I just happened to have a book on the World Summit stored in my subspace."

Eliana grimaced as if she'd been hit with culture shock. "...You store books in your subspace?"

"But the summit hardly ever happens, right?"

"Of course. With the amount of power and influence involved, the conditions for opening one are extremely strict. All four hero academies have to agree, and ultimately, it needs the Dragon Lord's approval."

Carl stroked his chin, muttering, "The last summit was about... a hundred years ago?"

"Ninety-seven years, to be exact."

"Wow."

A once-in-a-lifetime event. And they would get to witness it up close.

"I'm getting chills just thinking about it," Carl murmured.

Eliana groaned. "Yeah, but it also means more work for us. Imagine the chaos of preparing to host all those guests."

"Not to mention, plenty of people will want to see our school's students in action."

"We might even have to put on some kind of performance for them."

"So on top of preparing for finals, now we have to be treated like zoo animals?"

Complaints erupted across the table. Whenever a school hosted a major event, it was always the students who suffered.

Celia, who had been quietly listening, spoke up. "If the World Summit is happening, does that mean the Silent Dragon has finally broken her silence?"

The room fell silent.

The Silent Dragon.

It was the title of Melina, a being who had remained unseen for so long that her title had become synonymous with her absence.

"This summit is shaping up to be one for the history books," Celia murmured. 

It was a moment where the tides of the world were shifting.

Chelsea turned to Leo. "You're probably going to be the busiest of us all, Leo."

"Why?"

"You're the student council president. You'll have a ton to prepare, won't you?" 

She spoke between bites of cake, stuffing her cheeks like a squirrel.

Leo chuckled at the sight. "There are plenty of capable seniors above me. Why would I be busy?"

"But the vice president won't be back from his mission for a while, right?"

"Yeah, he won't."

"Then doesn't that mean you have to handle the preparations until he gets back?"

"I don't need to. Hark will take care of it. He actually gets more efficient under pressure."

Everyone shook their heads as Leo casually dismissed what would be a nightmare workload for anyone else.

*Is Leo really not scared of Hark?*

Even after a year at Lumene, with underclassmen of their own now, most second-years still feared their seniors. 

Hark, in particular, was the strongest fifth-year and the heir to one of Lumene's three great noble houses.

Yet Leo's only concern was how to make Hark do all the work.

As Leo stood to take his tray away, Eliana leaned in. "I'm so glad we're in the same year as him."

"Seriously. If we were his seniors or juniors, we'd be worked to the bone."

Chelsea nodded in agreement. "The power of a student council president comes from their ability to enforce decisions, but Leo... doesn't seem to care about that at all."

Celia propped her chin on one hand and murmured, "Yeah. He's completely tamed Hark. Hark might hold all the authority, but in the end... it always feels like Leo wins."

"Let's take a moment to pray for our seniors." Eliana clasped her hands together as if offering condolences.

Carl clicked his tongue. "You guys don't get it."

"What don't we get?" Chelsea looked at him curiously.

"Think about it. Why do you think Leo makes the seniors do all the work?"

"Because he's lazy and wants to take it easy," Eliana answered.

Her response earned her a round of unimpressed stares.

"Leo isn't you."

"Rude!"

"Even Chloe thinks so."

"Chloe! The other dorm kids are bullying me!"

Eliana turned to Chloe for help, but Chloe only nodded in agreement.

Carl smirked. "Leo uses the seniors because they're competent. But once they graduate, who do you think he'll start relying on?"

Everyone's faces stiffened.

"The seniors you're laughing at? That's *you* in the future." Carl snickered. "Well, that's just the price of being a smart, capable student. Too bad for you guys! I don't have any skills, so Leo won't bother using me."

He grinned confidently.

His classmates, however, narrowed their eyes.

*Somehow, you seem like the one who'll be used the most.*

Leo had a way of finding each person's strengths and wringing them dry.

"Want me to tell you the truth, Carl?" Chelsea muttered. "You're probably going to be the most overworked out of all of us."

Eliana smirked. "Let him have his moment."

"But it's annoying."

"Come on. His grades are at rock bottom, and he's definitely going to suffer the most. Just let him be happy while he can."

After a moment of consideration, Chelsea nodded.

With the upcoming World Summit looming over them, the first-years were buzzing with excitement.

"It's time to show the world what I'm made of."

"What if I get scouted by a kingdom stronger than my own?"

"Do you think they'll offer sponsorships? I heard some of the upperclassmen got those."

The first-years brimmed with anticipation, their faces full of confidence.

The fact that the World Summit was taking place right before finals only added to their excitement. Even for hero candidates, it was rare to have a chance to showcase their skills before the world's most powerful figures as mere first-years.

Final exams were the culmination of everything they'd achieved over the past semester. Having experienced their own growth firsthand, they were more eager than ever.

Gathered in the large auditorium of the first-year classroom building, students chattered away about their dreams and ambitions.

Watching them, Luke murmured, "Everyone seems to be looking forward to finals."

"You're not?" Haviden shot him a sharp look.

Luke forced a smile. "Honestly, I'll just be grateful if I can stay at Lumene for the second semester."

Laughter broke out around them.

"Pfft, did you hear that?"

"His *goal* is to make it to the second semester."

"Wow, the nerve. With those grades, he really thinks he can stay?"

"He's probably just banking on the student council president."

"Yeah, no doubt."

"But even with that kind of backing, isn't it unfair for a failing student to stay at Lumene?"

"Exactly."

"What if he drags the student council president down with him?"

"Now *that* would be entertaining."

"Nah, they'll probably just expel him."

"That's still unfair in its own way!"

Mocking laughter and jeers filled the auditorium.

"Shut up and stop barking," Haviden said coldly.

The students sneering at Luke immediately bristled.

"What did you just say?"

"Did you seriously just say that to us?"

Haviden was the second-ranked student in the knight department and one of the top five in the entire first-year class. Normally, people wouldn't dare talk back to him.

But these students were different. They were part of what was known as the Aina faction.

At Lumene, forming factions was practically a tradition. The school gathered talented individuals from all over the world, but even among them, certain students stood above the rest. Naturally, people would flock to those prodigies.

Among the fifth-years, Hark led the most dominant faction. Among the fourth-years, it was Elena. The third-years had Lily, though her nature and the individualistic tendencies of her classmates kept a strong faction from forming.

Initially, the second-years had been expected to split into multiple rival groups, leading to concerns among the faculty that they would become a fractured and dysfunctional generation rather than a golden one. But in the end, they became the least faction-driven class in Lumene's history.

As for the first-years, the most prominent faction revolved around their top student, Aina.

The problem?

Aina had no interest in factions.

She didn't manage them, nor did she acknowledge them.

The so-called Aina faction was simply a group of students clinging to her without her consent.

Since Aina was solely focused on training and studying, her so-called faction had started running wild.

Haviden smirked at the hostility directed toward him. "Interesting. I wonder if Aina Beidna will actually protect you if I beat you to a pulp."

The students flinched. Within the knight department, only Aina herself could stop Haviden.

"Just wait and see," one of them spat before storming off, the others following.

Haviden scoffed.

"Thanks for the help," Luke said awkwardly.

Haviden narrowed his eyes. "Cut the pathetic, clueless act, Luke Eldar."

"Huh?" Luke blinked in confusion at the sudden shift in tone.

Haviden stood up, his voice as cold as ice as he said, "You must think we're all blind. I know exactly how you look at me. How you look at the rest of us. And it's annoying."

Haviden knew.

This so-called failing student had his eyes on the top.

The first person to point it out had been Duran.

>"If anyone's aiming for the top, keep an eye on Luke Eldar."

At first, Haviden hadn't understood.

>"Leo Plov chose him for a reason. And his eyes—they belong to someone looking upward."

Duran had smirked.

>"Don't just look ahead or to the sides. Your rivals are behind you too."

And when Haviden actually looked into Luke's eyes, he realized it was true.

Luke was trying to surpass him. He just hadn't admitted it to himself yet.

*That's what makes it even more irritating.*

Then came the field mission.

Haviden and the other top students had been at the front lines. They had seen it.

The moment that Luke's swordplay had surpassed their own.

"Being ridiculously kind is just part of who you are, so I'll let that slide. But if you're going to challenge me..." Haviden smirked, his words a clear declaration. "Then show your fangs. That way, I can beat you down without hesitation."
