*Click—click—click.* 

Miss Laura walked briskly, taking a deep breath to steady herself. 

This morning, after finishing the faculty meeting, she was on her way to the classroom when she received unexpected news—Autren, the teacher in charge of the advanced first-year class, had stepped down due to health reasons. 

Of course, Laura knew the real reason behind his sudden departure. 

*Because he lost to Leo in a duel.* 

A mere student—one from Lumene, no less—had defeated him in a battle using Stellar Magic. The Pureblood Society, which had seized control of Seiren, would never tolerate such a disgrace. The result was inevitable: Autren was stripped of his position as homeroom teacher. 

Seiren's advanced first-year class was reserved for the most promising hero candidates, and only a select few teachers were granted the honor of overseeing them. 

As soon as the news broke, every teacher at the faculty meeting sharpened their gazes. 

Laura let out a deep sigh. 

*A sudden change in homeroom teachers right before midterms will only disrupt the students.* 

For the teachers, this was an opportunity, but for the students, it would cause nothing but confusion. 

*For now, I need to focus on teaching my own students well.* 

With exams approaching fast, the written tests at least had predefined material. But the practical exam—the most crucial part—had remained a mystery until today. 

During the faculty meeting, the details were finally revealed. She needed to inform her students immediately. 

*First period is Aura Studies.* 

Since the students were likely practicing independently, she would have to call them all together. 

*Creak—!* 

As she opened the door and stepped inside, Laura's eyes widened. 

The entire lower class was seated at their desks. 

"Good morning, Miss Laura!" 

The students greeted her brightly. 

"Good morning, everyone. But...the first period is Aura Studies, isn't it?" 

Normally, they would be scattered, studying on their own. Yet today, everyone was gathered in the classroom. 

It was unusual, and Laura couldn't hide her surprise. 

Leo answered her question. 

"We were self-studying." 

"Self-studying?" 

"Yes. The others had questions about my duel with Autren, so we were discussing it." 

He glanced around. Both knight and summoning majors were watching the blackboard intently, their eyes filled with eagerness. 

They were brimming with enthusiasm—just like when Laura taught Stellar Magic. 

"We were talking about how knights and summoners should strategize when facing a powerful mage." 

It was a type of lecture Laura herself couldn't provide. 

"Thank you, Lyle." 

Leo smiled and returned to his seat. 

Clearing her throat, Laura stepped up to the lectern. 

"Everyone, the assignment for your midterm practical exam was decided during today's faculty meeting." 

The room tensed. 

The practical exam was the most critical part of their midterms. 

Seeing their anxious expressions, Laura continued. 

"You will be tasked with subjugating a monster." 

"Monster subjugation?" 

The students blinked in surprise. 

"Yes. The test requires you to work together to defeat a powerful monster. Your ranking will be determined by how effectively you demonstrate strategy, tactics, and teamwork. The faster the team, the higher the score." 

Angel raised her hand. 

"Teacher, I have a question!" 

"Go ahead, Angel." 

"This isn't everything, is it?" 

"No." 

The lower class exchanged knowing looks, as if they had expected as much. 

"As you suspected, the challenge must be completed using only Stellar Magic." 

A collective sigh of frustration swept through the room. 

Watching their reactions, Laura spoke firmly. 

"Don't be discouraged. You all made your decision, didn't you? Think of this as an opportunity." 

Her voice carried conviction. 

"This is your chance to prove, beyond any doubt, that you do *not* belong in the lower class."

{sep}

"I don't really get it." 

Angel asked in a slightly puzzled tone. 

"The exam requires us to use only Stellar Magic, so why do we need to study Aura?" 

The grand hall where the lower class students usually trained was now filled with the entire lower class—knights, summoners, and mages alike. 

At Angel's question, Leo turned to her. 

"Are you a mage? Do you plan to walk the path of magic for the rest of your life?" 

"Not exactly, but..." 

"Then you need to be diligent in your main discipline too." 

With that, Leo looked at the summoner students. 

"The same goes for you." 

Bells, the de facto leader of the lower class summoners, raised his hand. 

"Lyle, I get what you're saying, but will a magic swordsman's training really help us summoners?" 

The other summoners nodded in agreement with Bells. 

Leo responded calmly. 

"The magic I'm about to teach will benefit all of you." 

"What kind of magic?" 

"Enhancement magic." 

Angel tilted her head. 

"Enhancement magic? But all the Stellar Magic-based enhancement spells are family heirlooms passed down among noble families. There aren't any publicly available versions, so how are we supposed to learn them?" 

Enhancement magic was a type of buff magic, originally inspired by fairy blessing spells. It was a technique Luna often used in close combat. 

In battle, Luna had fought fiercely on the frontlines while unleashing powerful magic—a combination rarely seen. 

But in modern times, such magic had only survived as secret techniques passed down through bloodlines. There were no standardized versions that anyone could learn. 

"There is one." 

At Leo's response, every student stared at him in shock. 

"It strengthens not just your body but also summoned beasts and spirits." 

Leo pulled out a portable chalkboard and began writing down a spell formula. 

It wasn't the original magic Luna had used, but a modern interpretation he had adapted for contemporary elves to use. 

*It's weaker than the original, but still plenty powerful.* 

"Whoa!" 

"Unbelievable!" 

Excited murmurs spread as the lower class students hurriedly copied the spell into their notebooks. 

Angel approached Leo, lowering her voice. 

"Is it really okay for you to just share this?" 

For a mage, knowing a spell that no one else had was an invaluable asset. 

And here he was, casually giving away a Stellar Magic enhancement spell—a priceless technique that, if widely known, would shake the foundations of the magical community. 

Seeing her hesitation, Leo answered with a slight smile. 

"Your great senior would've been furious if I didn't." 

"Who?" 

"Your ancestor." 

If Luna saw how the lower class students had been denied the opportunity to learn, she would have been livid. 

*She would've smashed the heads of every single member of that so-called Pureblood Society.* 

Leo chuckled at Angel. 

"Don't overthink it. Just focus on training. That's all that matters." 

Angel blinked at him, then blushed slightly. 

*He's a first-year like us, but he feels so mature.* 

Shaking off her thoughts, she opened her notebook and began copying down the spell. 

"Guys! Let's do our best! We'll show Seiren that we belong here just as much as anyone else!" 

Having taken on the role of class leader, Angel encouraged her peers. 

"Yeah!" 

"Let's do this!" 

The students cheered. 

{sep} 

"Tch. So noisy." 

From the hallway outside the training hall, a group of elf students sneered. 

"A lower class reject got lucky and beat Mr. Autren, and now they think they're special." 

"What's the point of all that effort?" 

The advanced first-year students mocked them. 

Their new homeroom teacher, Geras, spoke up with a smirk. 

"Those who are not chosen sometimes fall into the delusion that effort can overcome natural talent." 

He chuckled. 

"Your job is to prove them wrong. Show them how meaningless their so-called effort really is." 

At his words, the advanced students grinned confidently. 

*Creak—* 

Just then, Eclair cracked the door open slightly, peering inside at the lively atmosphere of the lower class students. 

"So jealous..." 

Unlike the advanced class, where students constantly tried to one-up each other and hoarded knowledge for their own benefit, the lower class students shared what they learned and laughed together. 

This was the kind of school life Eclair had always longed for. 

"Eclair." 

"Y-Yes?!" 

"What are you looking at?" 

Geras turned a cold gaze toward her. 

"Eclair, your position as a class representative is on the line this midterm. You should be more focused." 

"Y-Yes..." 

Shrinking under his reprimand, Eclair lowered her head. 

Her classmates chuckled at her misfortune, sending her hostile glances. 

*Even if I can't beat Lea, I should at least be able to surpass Eclair.* 

*Once the midterms are over, I'm taking that class representative position.* 

Under the weight of their gazes, Eclair curled in on herself. 

*Thud.* 

Just then, Elric, the second-ranked first-year, gave her a reassuring pat on the back. 

"Don't mind them." 

"I-I'm fine." 

Eclair smiled brightly, but her eyes lingered on the lower class students for just a moment before she turned away. 

"Now then, everyone, get ready. I'll be delivering a lesson unlike anything you've ever experienced." 

*I'm not like that fool Autren. I'll prove I'm the right teacher for the advanced class.* 

Geras had previously been in charge of the second advanced class. 

*But even that wasn't enough for me.* 

His lips curled into a smug smile.

"How is Leo Plov doing?" 

"He's mingling with the lower class students." 

"Hmph. How fitting." Lehagen scoffed. "I hope he at least learns something from Seiren's educational values." 

"That seems unlikely." Orlen smirked. "But Lehagen, are you really planning to burn Seiren's Hero Record?" 

Lehagen's expression turned icy. "Do you honestly believe that's an option?" 

Orlen flinched. 

"I don't know why Seiren left behind such a letter. But everything we do is for the glory of our great elven race. Even if it means going against Seiren's wishes, we have a duty to share the Hero Record with the world." 

Lehagen rose from his seat, gazing out over Seiren's grounds. 

"The era of the Nebula Pioneer, Luna, returning through the Hero Records is upon us." 

His eyes gleamed. 

"If Luna can return, then who's to say Seiren can't? Who's to say she won't descend upon this world once more?" 

"There's no reason why she couldn't." 

"Exactly! That's why we must preserve Seiren's Hero Record and pass it down to future generations." 

A wicked grin spread across Lehagen's face. 

"When word of Seiren's Hero Record spreads, our entire race will celebrate. The Tingel family will have no choice but to aid us in conquering Seiren's world." 

*Step—step—* 

Lehagen strode up to Seiren's Hero Record. 

"I'll announce it at the upcoming academic conference. Be ready." 

"Understood, Lehagen."
