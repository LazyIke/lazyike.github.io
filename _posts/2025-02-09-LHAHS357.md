*Fwoosh—!* 

Pure white flames surged forth, consuming Erebos's fire. Gasps filled the air. 

"Is that the legendary Phoenix King's flame?" 

"The flame that was said to have vanished five thousand years ago..." 

Mages attending the conference watched in awe. Five thousand years ago, the legacy of the flames inherited by the Phoenix Kings had been severed by Erebos. 

This legendary fire, which had become nothing more than a tale of the distant past, was now manifesting in Lunia's hands. And it wasn't just any magic—it was a spell created by Luna herself. 

A miracle, unfolding once again after five thousand long years. The mages couldn't help but feel reverence in the face of such a phenomenon. 

*It's not enough.* 

However, Lunia narrowed her eyes, unsatisfied. The white flames swirling around her burned even hotter. 

*Still... it's not enough.* 

There was a reason Luna created this magic. A reason Katariou had entrusted her with the flames of purification in Dweno's world. This fire, which not even Luna had fully perfected, hadn't ignited in Lunia's hands by mere coincidence. It was the result of interwoven fates—a miracle born from countless connections. 

She glanced down at Flame Emperor, the staff that Dweno had given her.

*This must mean our generation is meant to finish it once and for all.* 

Luna, who had shone even in endless darkness. Dweno, who had stood resolute before an unseen catastrophe. Aaron, who had shown the greatest courage in the face of utter despair. The images of the Great Heroes she had met and witnessed flashed through Lunia's mind. 

*Fwoosh—!* 

The purifying flames blazed even brighter. A dangerous, double-edged fire, one that could just as easily consume even its wielder. A power far too immense for someone still as inexperienced as her. 

But Lunia didn't hesitate. She had seen Leo charge into the heart of Erebos's flames without a moment's pause. 

*You think you're the only one who gets to act cool?* 

A faint smile formed on her lips as she recalled the boy who had suddenly appeared a year ago and changed her life. 

Leo Plov. An All-Class hero, just like the Hero of the Beginning, Kyle. Somehow, to Lunia, Leo reminded her of Kyle. 

Of course, she knew little about Kyle himself. His existence had only been confirmed in recent years. Records of Kyle were scarce, and few stories about him remained except mere fairy tales. No one truly knew why he was called the Hero of the Beginning or what deeds he had accomplished. 

And yet, Lunia couldn't shake the feeling that Leo and Kyle were alike. 

*Maybe Kyle was called the Hero of the Beginning because he was the start of something. Just like Leo... is the beginning of this great tide.* 

*Fwoosh—!* 

Lunia's flames surged even higher, drawing all eyes to her. She gripped Flame Emperor with both hands, complex magic formulas intertwining. 

"Flame Emperor!" 

As the spell completed, a massive, pure white flame manifested above Erebos's black fire, blazing like a radiant sun. 

While the onlookers gaped, the sun-like flames devoured the black fire. 

*Fwoosh—!* 

In an instant, Erebos's flames were purified. The white embers that scattered through the air carried warmth rather than destruction. As the remnants of those flames landed upon the rampaging undead, they were burned away. 

The catastrophic black flames, the deathly aura of the undead… all were wiped from existence. 

A soft breeze, reminiscent of a spring day, swept through the area. 

Everyone stared at Lunia, overwhelmed by the sheer power she had displayed. 

"Lunia!" Eiran rushed toward her, panicked at the burns marring her body. 

"I'm fine," Lunia reassured her with a smile. 

"So it really did burn away all that was impure..." 

"A purification in the truest sense." 

While everyone marveled at Lunia's magic, a book fluttered down from the sky. Seiren's Hero Record. 

Lunia reached out and caught the cause of this entire disaster. Yet, for some reason, the Hero Record containing Seiren's history was perfectly intact, as if it had just been rewritten. 

*That's strange. It was definitely burned to almost nothing earlier.* 

She frowned. She had never heard of a destroyed Hero Record restoring itself. 

As she stared at it in confusion— 

*Fwoosh—!* 

A brilliant light burst from the Hero Record, and from that light, Leo emerged. 

"Huh?" Lunia's eyes widened in shock. 

Leo's face was right in front of hers, so close she could feel his breath. 

Her mind immediately flashed back to when he had grabbed her chin. Her face burned red. 

*"That felt... way too intimate just now."* 

And for some reason, Eiran's teasing words came to mind, making her flush even more. 

Leo gave her a knowing smile—then reached out and took her hand. 

*W-Wait, what is he doing?! Why is he suddenly grabbing my hand in front of everyone?!* 

Just as her face turned completely red, Leo spoke. "Would you mind letting go?" 

"Huh? Oh... Eh?!" Lunia let out a strange noise as realization struck. 

Leo wasn't grabbing *her* hand—he was pulling at the Hero Record in her grasp. Flustered, she quickly released it, and Leo took a step back. 

Meanwhile, Lunia, who had momentarily let her imagination run wild, felt her embarrassment reach her ears. 

"Lunia, are you okay?" Eiran asked, concerned.

"I'm fine... but wasn't the atmosphere kind of strange just now?" 

Eiran tilted her head in confusion. "Atmosphere? What atmosphere?" 

Lunia sighed in relief. "Nothing." 

Eiran narrowed her eyes. "Lunia, were you thinking something weird?" 

"You started this!" Lunia snapped. 

"Eh? That's unfair!" Eiran protested with teary eyes. 

"Leo." 

A voice interrupted. 

Herdium, a Seiren instructor acquainted with Leo, approached. His gaze landed on the book in Leo's hands. 

"That... is that truly Seiren's Hero Record?" 

"Yeah." 

"Then why... why did the flames of calamity emerge from it?" 

"You'll find out if you ask the owner directly," Leo replied. 

"What...?" Herdium frowned in confusion. 

*Flash—!* 

A gateway opened in midair. A perfectly oval, pure white entrance. 

Herdium immediately recognized it—a portal to the Hero World. 

Gasps filled the air. 

Leo reached into the portal. Moments later, a slender hand grasped his.

A breathtakingly beautiful elf stepped into the light. 

Herdium, upon seeing her, was so shocked that he dropped his staff. 

"Ah... Aaah..." Herdium's voice trembled. 

It wasn't just him. Everyone who saw the elf before them wore expressions of utter disbelief. 

"Seiren...?" 

It was difficult to believe. But they had already witnessed the return of the Nebula Pioneer last winter. Now, faced with Seiren standing before them, they had no choice but to accept the truth. 

As if responding to the miracle wrought by the Hero Record, the elves knelt as one. 

And it wasn't just the elves. The mages who had traveled to Seiren for the academic conference followed suit. 

The Comet Mage—hailed as the greatest in history after Luna. A member of the Heroes of Dawn, who had once again saved a world on the brink of collapse. No one could refuse to bow their heads. 

Even Lunia and Eiran, who had been bickering moments ago, lowered their heads in shock. 

Seiren's eyes wavered. Among the crowd, she saw students clad in Seiren Academy's uniform. Her gaze drifted from Lunia and Eiran to the countless young faces looking back at her. 

"This is the new generation, the sprouts born from the seeds you planted," Leo murmured, just loud enough for her to hear. "Countless hero candidates have followed the path you paved, reaching toward what lies ahead. And because of that, many heroes have been born." 

The Age of Heroes. The era that began five thousand years ago, when the Great Heroes defeated Erebos and the gods bestowed the Hero Record upon the mortal world. But it was after the Heroes of Dawn that heroes began emerging at an explosive rate. 

"You asked if you did well?" 

While everyone else remained kneeling, Leo reached out and ruffled Seiren's hair. 

"You did more than well. You achieved what Lysinas dreamed of for so long. So stop blaming yourself. Make sure you tell the others, too." 

"...Yes." Seiren nodded, her voice firm. Then, she took a deep breath and turned to the gathered crowd. "Raise your heads." 

At her command, everyone lifted their gazes. 

She looked around. In the distance, she saw what remained of the Comet Sanctum—reduced to nothing but ash and rubble. Reaching out, she called upon her magic. 

*Vwoom—!* 

A brilliant light shot from the ruins like a comet, landing in her grasp. 

Cometes, the staff that symbolized Seiren herself. 

*Ziiing—!* 

Mana surged from the staff's tip, and in an instant, the ruined Comet Sanctum was restored to its original state. 

Gasps erupted from the crowd. It was as if time had reversed. 

*No, she actually reversed time!* 

Even mages who had ascended to the ranks of heroes wouldn't dare attempt such magic, and yet, she had done it effortlessly. 

"Everyone," Seiren addressed the students, "I am but a relic of the past to you. However, as the founder of this academy, seeing all of you here brings me great joy." 

The students of Seiren Academy gazed at her in awe. 

"And so, I have a request." 

Her expression darkened. 

"Long ago, I made a grave mistake. I established a rule that only those who had mastered Stellar Magic could enter this academy." 

A tradition that had persisted for three thousand years. Now, she called it a mistake. 

The crowd was stunned. 

Seiren glanced at Leo. Before stepping into the outside world, she had already learned of the academy's current state. 

"As the founder of this school, I hereby abolish that rule." 

Eyes widened. Some gasped as if suffering a heart attack. 

The Pureblood Society members, in particular, visibly flinched. 

"And... Leo Plov." Seiren turned to Leo with a gentle smile. "You've restored something I could never solve—the Magic of Blooming Flowers, Luna's legacy. Thank you. I believe you are a far more fitting mage for this staff than I ever was." 

Leo blinked, then let out a quiet chuckle. 

On the other hand, the elves were horrified. 

Seiren was offering Cometes to Leo. For a mage to gift their staff to another—it was an act that symbolized recognition of them as a successor. 

Shock rippled through the crowd as they looked back and forth between Seiren and Leo. 

Leo, looking rather unimpressed, accepted the staff. The moment it touched his hands, Cometes shone brilliantly. 

Then, as if time had run out, Seiren's body began to glow. 

Everyone instinctively shut their eyes—except Leo, who alone saw her clearly. 

"My apologies, Sir Kyle," she said, sticking her tongue out playfully. 

Leo smirked. "You know, even Luna never managed to pull this off. That's impressive." 

A distant memory resurfaced—Luna once demanding that he call her "Master" just because she had taught him a single spell. He had ignored her, refusing to accept the staff she tried to force onto him. 

Seiren lifted the hem of her dress and bowed gracefully. "An infinite honor." 

Then, with a playful smile, she added, "But now, foolish children will never dare to disrespect you again." 

"That's the only reason I'm letting this slide," Leo muttered. 

"Fufu." Seiren covered her mouth, laughing. 

Leo looked at her and said, "Just hang in there a little longer. I'll be there soon." 

"I will. I'll be waiting!" 

With a bright smile, Seiren faded away. 

And just like that, the light disappeared, leaving only Leo standing there. 

The crowd stared at him in stunned silence. 

"This... this is impossible..." Orlen's voice trembled. "A human... A human was acknowledged by Seiren?! I won't accept this!" 

His face twisted in fury, his body shaking violently. 

Leo smirked. Then, he casually lifted Cometes, waving it. "But I *did* receive this from Seiren herself." 

It was undeniable. The founder of Seiren Academy had personally handed him Cometes. No one could refute it. 

The Pureblood Society's members trembled. 

As shock rippled through the conference attendees—students, professors, and visiting mages alike—Leo tightened his grip on Cometes. 

"Now then..." His voice turned cold. "Let's find out why Erebos's flames were pouring out of the Hero Record... and why the undead appeared in the middle of Seiren." 

The Pureblood Society members turned deathly pale.

*I won't accept this! This is betrayal! That damned Lich King!* 

Lehagen seethed inwardly. 

From the moment the Hero Record had ignited with black flames and the undead had appeared atop the Comet Sanctum, he knew that he was finished. 

*I should have never made a deal with those filthy demons! I'll hold them accountable for this! If only I had obtained Seiren's remains and used necromancy…* 

*Step—* 

"Where do you think you're going, Acting Headmaster of Seiren?" 

Lehagen froze. 

*Step. Step.* 

Behind him, Leo approached, his gaze icy.
