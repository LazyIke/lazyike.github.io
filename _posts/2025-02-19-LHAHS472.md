*Chirp— Chirp—*

The birds announced the arrival of morning.

"Ugh..." From beneath the blankets, Lily let out a pained groan and shifted. Her head throbbed from a terrible hangover. "Water..."

"Here."

As she sat up and clutched her pounding head, someone beside her handed her a glass of water.

"Ah, thank you, Leo." Lily forced a smile and gulped down the water.

*Pfft?! Kehek?! Cough! Cough!*

But then, she choked and began coughing violently.

"Wh-Why why why why why why why is Leo here?!" she asked, panicking.

Leo casually took a sip from his own glass and replied, "This is my room. Last night, Senior Lily was so drunk that you didn't return to your room and ended up sleeping here."

Hearing that, Lily fell into thought before covering her face with one hand. "I made a fool of myself... I'm sorry, Leo."

Her ears turned visibly red. Taking a deep breath, she climbed out of bed and said, "Leo, if something like this happens again, just throw me out of the room."

"I didn't have any improper thoughts."

"I know Leo isn't the type to do anything like that. What I mean is that I can't afford strange rumors."

"That's true. You could run into trouble in more ways than one."

"It's not me, it's you who would be in more trouble." Lily let out a small sigh. "You've been under the world's spotlight since last year, and now, you're a recognized hero. Many people admire and look up to you, but at the same time, just as many will be envious and resentful."

"That's probably true."

"Yes. Those people will do whatever they can to tarnish your reputation. A messy scandal involving women would be an easy target." Lily sighed. "Of course, if you look back at history, there have been plenty of lecherous heroes. Many have even committed immoral acts. Just look at the Justice Guild—they're hardly a respectable organization. People are aware of that. They know that no one is perfect."

*Shwaa—*

Lily walked over to the window and pulled open the curtains. Sunlight poured into the room. 

Squinting slightly from the brightness, she turned back to Leo. "But even so, people still want an ideal hero. Right now, that ideal hero in their minds is you, Leo."

"I don't really care about how others perceive me, so you don't have to worry."

"Hmm, you certainly have remarkable resilience. But personally, I want you to remain an untarnished hero."

"Why?"

"Because I like you." With the sunlight at her back, Lily smiled. "I've admired you since the first time we met. Even though you're my junior, I've always thought you were amazing. I was a fan from the start."

"I'm honored."

"That's why I'm asking again. Seriously, this time." Lily stepped in front of Leo and knelt down. "I want to be your disciple. Please accept me, Leo."

Her face was solemn and sincere.

"......"

*Please teach me well. Take me as your disciple.*

He recalled the bright-eyed elf girl, filled with hope for an unseen future.

*Take me as your disciple.*

He also recalled the human girl standing before him, her gaze burning with determination.

The two disciples, born in the darkest era, had pursued vastly different paths.

He had once asked them in an exasperated tone.

> "What will you do once you become stronger?"
>
> "I want to contribute to this world, even just a little."
>
> "I will dedicate myself to the world."

*Velkia and Bihar had completely different personalities, yet...*

> "I will achieve world peace. I want to create a world without war."

*Why do they all have the same look in their eyes?*

A gaze that did not waver. A heart that prioritized the world over themselves.

In a way, Lily reminded Leo of Lysinas.

Leo finally sighed, "I won't go easy on you."

"That's exactly what I want!"

"I won't bother with formalities either."

"That's fine! Honestly, Leo—no, Master—has always felt like an older brother to me." Lily beamed, then paused and asked an odd question, "Now that I think about it, wouldn't it be weird for a senior like me were to call my junior 'Master' in front of others?"

"Then just talk normally. Why not start speaking casually to me, too?"

Lily firmly shook her head. "I can't do that. Regardless of age, I can't disrespect a superior's title."

As someone from a military family, she was rigid about hierarchy.

"Hmm. If 'Master' feels too formal, should I call you 'Oppa'?"

"Wouldn't that attract even stranger looks?"

"That's true."

After some thought, Lily casually suggested, "Then... how about 'Hyung-nim'?"

*What the hell? Why are all my disciples so damn weird?*

Leo seriously pondered the question.

If Luna were here, she would probably say, "Because you're not normal either."

But Luna wasn't here.

Leo and Lily changed into their uniforms and headed to the audience chamber to meet the king.

The king had suggested postponing the meeting until the evening, citing the aftereffects of the banquet, but Leo found it absurd that it was delayed not just to the afternoon but all the way to the evening, though he also understood.

*Considering he's the kind of man who would throw a massive banquet despite his nation being on the brink of collapse, this isn't surprising.*

Therefore, he had issued a threat.

"If His Majesty refuses to see us now, we will consider that as a lack of interest in assistance and return to Lumene. Whether the kingdom perishes or not is up to you."

With that, the panicked ministers scrambled frantically, barely managing to secure an audience for the morning.

"Your Majesty, Sir Leo Plov and Lady Lily Luce have arrived."

"Let them enter."

*Creak—*

The doors opened, and Leo and Lily stepped into the council chamber where affairs of state were discussed.

The first thing that caught their eyes was, of course, the King of Carnel, seated at the head of the table. His eyes, dulled by intoxication, stared at Leo and Lily with a displeased expression.

"Welcome, Lord Plov, Lady Luce. But to seek an audience so urgently when the fatigue of the banquet hasn't even faded yet... Is there some pressing matter?"

His tone and demeanor were entirely unbefitting of a ruler whose nation was in crisis.

*A man who believes it is only natural for him to be above others.*

Even during the Age of Calamity, such people existed. Men who did nothing yet considered their privileges a given simply because they were born into the right family. And without exception, their end was always miserable.

*It's only in times of peace that people can afford to tolerate them.*

In times of stability, inherited wealth and status could protect a person. But in a lawless world, bloodlines held no value. Yet their greed—the belief that they deserved more than others—remained unchecked. Thus, countless royals and nobles were slaughtered during the Age of Calamity.

*Of course, after that, the ones who took power were often just as rotten, only more capable.*

When Lysinas ruled Godthrone, the city was strictly governed based on merit.

*Lysinas wasn't just administratively skilled, her ability to judge people was downright eerie.*

In truth, it was largely thanks to Lysinas that Tartaros's invasion had been held off until the end, rather than Erebos's subjugation.

Leo narrowed his eyes.

Lily looked like she was on the verge of saying something, but she held back because of Leo.

Leo spoke first. "Does the Justice Guild have a reason for trying to destroy the Carnel Kingdom?"

The king scoffed. "How should I know why a guild that preaches justice would side with the petty, insignificant kingdom of Petimen instead of our great and historically rich Carnel?"

"But surely there must be a reason?"

"Hmph. Seeing as they've been desecrating the graves of heroes lately, they're probably after the heritage of the Carnel Kingdom."

"Is there something in Carnel that the Justice Guild would covet? And how does that connect to their grave robbing?"

At Leo's question, the King of Carnel flinched before clutching his head. "Ugh… my head aches terribly. Attend me!"

"Yes, Your Majesty!" A servant immediately bowed.

"My hangover is unbearable!"

"Yes, Your Majesty. I shall bring food and drink to ease your condition at once."

Leo narrowed his eyes. *So he has no intention of talking. But the ones robbing the heroes' graves were the Justice Guild?*

The exact reason remained unclear. But from the king's reaction, it was certain that the Justice Guild was indeed plundering the tombs of heroes in this land.

*Could it be related to the Lich King?*

Leo already knew the Justice Guild wasn't a rational organization. And if there was anyone who knew how to manipulate such groups, it was the Lich King.

"In any case, what matters now is that the Justice Guild has unjustly intervened in this war and is threatening our kingdom. We officially request Lumene's mediation."

Seeing the king feign ignorance, Leo smirked.

After exchanging a few more words, he left the audience chamber.

Leo clenched his left hand.

*Crack—*

A chilling sound echoed from his bones.

*Should I make him talk?*

Getting a useless king to confess was nothing difficult. Bihar had torn out the section of Kyle's Hero Record that detailed his deeds as a Shadow, because those Pages contained methods of interrogation that were too brutal to be left in history.

That was why Bihar had personally removed it. She didn't want her master to be remembered that way by future generations.

As Leo walked down the corridor, deep in thought, Lily was also lost in contemplation.

"He's definitely hiding something. But what?"

"Would you allow me to explain that part?" A voice spoke from behind.

Leo and Lily turned to look. A boy, appearing to be in his late teens, stood there. His eyes were sharp, yet his face was shadowed with weariness.

Lily tilted her head. "And you are?" 

The boy introduced himself. "My name is Jeremy Carnel, and I am the Crown Prince of this kingdom."

He greeted them politely before speaking gravely. "There is something important I must tell you both. May I have a moment of your time?"

The place Jeremy led them to was outside the royal palace. They traveled by carriage.

Along the way, Lily discreetly pulled back the curtain to observe the scenery outside. Upon seeing the royal insignia on the carriage, the citizens immediately bowed their heads in haste, but their eyes were anything but reverent. Their clothes were tattered, and their faces were worn with hardship.

"The kingdom must be in dire straits," Lily remarked.

Jeremy sighed deeply. "It can't be helped. I hesitate to say this, but... my father and his ministers grow more tyrannical with each passing day."

His expression was filled with bitterness. "They neglect state affairs and indulge in decadence. When the Petimen Kingdom launched their grand invasion, they were so panicked that they didn't even hold banquets. But the moment they heard of your arrival, they acted like they had been waiting for an excuse to indulge themselves..."

Jeremy's expression twisted in disgust. It was clear he truly loathed his father and the ministers.

"So, what is it you wanted to explain?" Leo asked.

Jeremy responded. "The reason the Justice Guild is targeting our kingdom. And it's something Lumene would also find quite interesting."

"What is it?"

"The Justice Guild is after the tomb of the Nether Knight. They've heard rumors that it lies somewhere in our kingdom, and they seek it."

"The tomb of the Nether Knight? Isn't that just a legend?" Lily tilted her head.

Jeremy shook his head. "No. It is a secret that has been passed down through the royal family. I cannot confirm its exact location, but I can assure you it exists."

Leo fell into thought.

*The Nether Knight.*

He knew of him. And he had heard of the countless relics the hero had left behind.

*The Nether Knight didn't just bury the weapons of his fallen comrades—he took those of his defeated enemies as well.*

The Nether Knight was known by many names. The most famous was the Hero Emperor. But another well-known title was the Conqueror.

He had conquered countless territories and slain numerous heroes. It was said that he buried all of their weapons within his tomb.

If those artifacts were found, Lumene would benefit immensely.

*Not just Lumene. Other races would, too.*

The heroes defeated by the Nether Knight weren't only human.

[Listen carefully, Kyle.]

He froze in his footsteps.

[Listen to the voices of the dead.]

Startled, he turned around. "Lysinas?"

*Shwaa—*

No response came. Only an empty landscape stretched before him.
