The middle-aged man seated on the throne spoke in a low voice.

"So, Lumene's students have finally entered the country?"

"Yes, Your Majesty."

"How utterly disrespectful!"

*Bang!*

King Vehir III of Aleham slammed his armrest in rage. "On what grounds do they dare to suspect me and conduct an investigation in my land?!"

As his fury erupted, his vassals bowed their heads, avoiding his gaze. Everyone swallowed dryly.

Aleham—the nation infamous as the world's greatest slum. A country where all manner of illicit activities were legal, shunned by other nations. A land where countless citizens were discarded and left to starve, earning it a reputation as a living hell. A kingdom looked down upon by the world.

But within Aleham, the king's authority was absolute.

Vehir III had plunged his country into ruin to amass wealth and power, attracting nobles who fed off his influence like parasites. In Aleham, the king's word was law and truth.

Yet that authority meant nothing to Lumene.

Unlike Aleham's king, who wasn't even acknowledged as a proper ruler on the international stage, Lumene was a transnational institution. It trained hero candidates who would lead the world. Its students were the future of their respective nations. The academy gathered the most talented individuals from countless countries—including those from families powerful enough to erase Aleham from the map.

The mere presence of hundreds of such individuals, over whom he had no control, in his land was enough to fill Vehir III with immense irritation.

One of the nobles, sensing the tension, cautiously spoke. "Today, Lumene's students visited the royal palace to meet with the court mages and..."

*Crash!*

"Ack!"

Vehir III flung his golden wine goblet, his rage intensifying. "Not only did those impudent brats dare to set foot in my land, but now they've defiled my palace with their filthy presence?!"

His voice thundered through the hall. "What are you fools doing?! You call yourselves my nobles, my vassals, yet you allow those arrogant, milk-smelling whelps to act as they please?!"

His vassals could only bow their heads in silence.

Even if they wanted to stop Lumene, they couldn't.

The reason Lumene had sent students this time was solely for Hero Dungeon exploration. 

Hero Records belonged to the hero academies. Leaving a Hero Dungeon unattended posed a global threat, and retrieving them was essential to maintaining world peace. Also, once a Hero Dungeon was retrieved, Lumene never used it for personal gain.  

No country had the right to obstruct Lumene's investigations. This wasn't some unspoken rule—it was world law, decreed 3,000 years ago by Rodia, the Dawn Dragon, who had gathered all the world's heroes and rulers to establish it.  

But here, no noble dared to voice that fact. Speaking such words would likely cost them their heads.

As the court fell into heavy silence, a voice broke through.

"Please, calm yourself, Your Majesty."

"Hmph! Duke Evren."

At the words of the young man who had entered the chamber, Vehir III's anger subsided. The nobles' expressions brightened at his arrival.

Darian Evren.

Five years ago, he had settled in Aleham, quickly rising to become Vehir III's closest confidant. He was the one person in the entire kingdom whom the arrogant Vehir III truly respected.

And ten years prior, Darian had graduated from Lumene.  

For centuries, Aleham had failed to produce even a single Lumene student, let alone a graduate. Yet now, the country had claimed a Lumene graduate as its own.

Though his existence was unknown to the outside world, everyone present knew how deeply involved he was in Aleham's governance. His presence, as the only one capable of calming Vehir III, was a welcome relief to the nobles.

"Lumene's arrogance is something I know all too well," Darian said, shaking his head as if disgusted. "But there's no way to stop them. They think of themselves as the law."

Vehir III clenched his fists, his hands trembling in anger.

"However, do not worry, Your Majesty." Darian bowed gracefully. "After all, they are merely first- and second-year students. There is no chance they will find your treasure."  

Vehir III's expression relaxed.

The one overseeing the concealment of Aleham's Hero Dungeon was none other than Darian himself.

No matter how many students had come to investigate, they were only first- and second-years. And the one hiding the Hero Dungeon was a Lumene graduate. The gap in skill was obvious.

"But isn't Leo Plov among Lumene's second-years?" Vehir III frowned.

"Leo Plov... Yes, I've heard he's quite the monstrous junior," Darian said with a smirk. "But at the end of the day, he's still just a second-year, lacking experience. No matter how extraordinary, he's still a student."

"Hm. Darian, I'll leave it to you." Vehir III, reassured, nodded.  

Darian smiled. "I will restore Aleham to its former glory."

Leo exited the Pleasure District and headed straight for the inn.  

Laruel had been hiding her true identity as the Great Spirit of Light, operating as the mistress of the Pleasure Palace, a cornerstone of Aleham's underworld.  

[I've never been interested in Hero Dungeons. But this country has been acting strangely for at least five years. That much, I do know.]

As the owner of the Pleasure Palace, Laruel couldn't ignore the rumors that naturally came her way.  

Leo soon arrived at the main street.

"Leo! Which inn are you staying at? I haven't booked mine yet," Chelsea said, eyes gleaming.

Before Leo could answer, Eliana gasped. "Chelsea! You're trying to team up with the class rep to coast through the assignment, aren't you?! Don't even think about it! I will be in his party!"  

"No, not you," Leo said in a deadpan voice.

"Wait, was that what you were thinking?" Chelsea asked, dumbfounded.  

Chloe gave Eliana a half-lidded stare.

Eliana quickly covered her mouth.

"Class 5 really relies on Leo a lot," Chloe said, crossing her arms with a knowing smile. "Class 1 isn't like that."

Back in their first year, Class 1 and Class 5 had been rivals, constantly competing.

Their homeroom teacher, Sedgen, had always preached, 'Defeat Harrid!' 

Naturally, Class 1 had absorbed that mindset, refusing to lose against Class 5.  

Class 5 initially ignored it, but eventually, the competition stuck. With Celia in Class 1, Chelsea had pushed her friends relentlessly, refusing to lose.

Even now, with dormitory-based competition replacing class rivalries, the old tension between Class 1 and Class 5 lingered.

Chelsea scoffed. "Don't lump me in with that idiot."

"Yeah. Not all of us are like Eliana," Carl added.

"Hey! Carl, you're the last person who should say that! Aren't you trying to coast off the class rep too?" Eliana accused.

For once, Carl was innocent.

"Oh, no, no. I would never do something so underhanded." He shook his head with exaggerated righteousness.  

"The most important part of this assignment is gathering intel. That's my specialty." Carl smirked, resting his chin on his hand. "I've already gotten a ton of collaboration requests. So, Chloe and I formed a party. Unlike *some people.*"  

"Urgh!" Eliana grimaced, unable to argue.  

"Since we're all here, why don't we share intel?" Carl suggested.

"You found something in the Pleasure District?"  

"Yeah. Something very useful."

"Alright, let's meet at Leo's inn," Chelsea said.

Leo sighed as Eliana clung to him. 

Chelsea groaned, then begrudgingly pulled her away.

"Senior Leo! Welcome! Senior Chelsea, you're here too!" Luke, who had been waiting at the inn, greeted them cheerfully.  

Chelsea, however, frowned as she glanced around. "You picked this place for lodging?"  

Luke's expression turned serious. "I knew it... A hotel where every room has a private shower is too extravagant, isn't it?"

He had chosen a clean and comfortable hotel, but that was all. In a city filled with luxurious accommodations, this place looked almost pitiful in comparison. 

Yet, for Luke, who had grown up in the countryside, even this felt like an unimaginable luxury.  

"Here! They give out free drinks as a service!" He eagerly handed them glasses of juice.

Chelsea gave him a slightly pitying look, but before she could say anything, Leo spoke. "Luke, wait in the lounge. When Chloe, Carl, and Eliana arrive, bring them up to my room. Chelsea, you should freshen up too."

"Okay."

"Got it."

Leaving those words behind, Leo headed upstairs.

Inside the bathroom, he let the shower run over him as he spoke. "Laruel, what do you mean by 'suspicious movements' in this country for the past five years?"

[It's exactly what it sounds like. The royal palace has been secretly exploring specific areas.]

"Where?"

[The underground of this city, Wargella, and the Monster Forest. The Hero Dungeon is probably in the Monster Forest.]

*Shhhhhh...*

Leo ran his fingers through his hair, puzzled. "How can you be sure the Hero Dungeon is in the Monster Forest?"

[I know what's beneath Wargella.]

"What's down there?"

[Rodia's treasury.]

Leo froze.

Stepping out of the shower, he grabbed a towel, dried himself off, slipped on pants, and pulled on a robe.

"Rodia's treasury?"

[Yes. A vault Rodia left behind for her future contractor.]

"Hmm." Leo stroked his chin in deep thought.

*Knock, knock.*

"Leo, I'm coming in," Chelsea called from outside.

"Come in."

*Click!*

"Ugh, Leo, this hotel's bathroom sucks. The hot water wouldn't work, so I had to use magic..." She trailed off mid-sentence. 

The room was dim, bathed only in the soft glow of moonlight.

Against that light, Leo stood, rubbing his hair with a towel. His robe hung loosely over his shoulders, exposing his toned chest.

Despite his delicate features, his body, well honed through combat and training, held an undeniable masculine strength.  

"Wow, you really are different from my brother," Chelsea murmured in awe.

Being Abad's sister, she had often seen him in relaxed moments, but Leo's presence was entirely different.

Chelsea let out a small, appreciative hum, studying him with fascination.

Leo chuckled. "What's so interesting?"

"It's just... We always study magic together, so I forget sometimes. But seeing you like this, I can really tell how much you've trained as a knight." She stepped closer. "Can I touch your muscles?"  

Her question was purely out of curiosity.

Leo let out a short laugh before nodding.

*Poke, poke.*

"Wow, it's firm but elastic. So this is what a man's body feels like," she murmured, pressing against his arm.

Her gaze drifted downward. For some reason, an intense urge to touch his chest surfaced.  

*He said I could touch his muscles, so a little wouldn't hurt, right?*

She swallowed hard before hesitantly placing her hand on his chest.

Unlike his arm, it had a different firmness, a strange yet intriguing texture.

As she marveled at the sensation, a sudden realization struck her.

*If someone saw this, it'd look really bad.*

Trying to stay composed, Chelsea withdrew her hand...

*Bang!*

"Leo! I'm here!"

The door burst open, and Carl strode in—only to freeze.

The room's atmosphere was... odd.

Leo, hair still damp, dressed in nothing but a robe.

And Chelsea, who was fondling Leo's chest.  

Carl slowly lowered his head. "Sorry for interrupting."  

*Creak...*

Just as he started closing the door...

*Whoosh!*

A powerful gust of wind pulled him back inside.

It was Chelsea's magic.  

"It's not what you think," she insisted.

Carl kept his head down. "I apologize. I saw nothing. Please, continue."

"It's not like that. I was just curious and wanted to feel his muscles."

"You don't have to explain. Your secret is safe with me. I'll take it to my grave."

"I said it's not what you think!"

Carl sighed, looking genuinely betrayed. "Chelsea... I literally saw you *groping* a wet, half-dressed Leo. You expect me to believe you're innocent? I thought we were close. Friends don't keep secrets like this."  

"You fucking moron. Do you have any idea how many times Leo and I have seen each other drenched in sweat?"  

Carl gasped. "Since when—?"

"From training, you idiot! Stop thinking dirty thoughts!" Chelsea, who had been maintaining her composure, finally exploded.  

Leo finished toweling his hair dry and muttered, "Kids these days sure are bold."  

Elsie sighed. [No Leo, you're just way too defenseless,]
