The streets of Dovela.

A place where mercenaries from all over the world and countless different races gathered—naturally, it was a city where fights never ceased. But now, the streets of Dovela were eerily silent.

"...I heard this place was supposed to be rough and filthy," Carl muttered, sounding almost disappointed.

"Far from rough or filthy, the streets are unbelievably clean," Chelsea added, shrugging.

The streets, which should have been littered with empty bottles, passed-out drunkards, and all sorts of filth, were spotless—so much so that the emptiness felt almost unsettling. Not a single drunkard was in sight, and even the usual drunken chatter from taverns was absent.

"I think I know why," Chloe murmured, surveying the surroundings.

"Why is that?"

Her mentee, Betty, looked up at her with eager eyes. She sincerely admired Chloe and wanted to learn everything from her.

Chloe pointed to several buildings. Their walls bore marks as if they had been scorched by lightning. Looking closer, similar burn marks were scattered across the walls and the ground.

"This is the prince's handiwork."

"Yeah, knowing Duran, he'd definitely clean up the streets the moment he saw them," Carl said.

Hearing that, Juen frowned in confusion. "Why would Senior Duran bother with something so tedious?"

Leo shrugged and glanced at Carl. Carl, who had been grinning, suddenly put on an expressionless face, his lips curling ever so slightly.

Juen stepped back, cringing. "What's with that creepy look?"

"I get it now. That's the smug, self-righteous face of someone arrogant and self-important," Chelsea said, giggling.

Carl, still in character, mimicked Duran's voice. "How filthy. You'd better clean up this mess before my eyes, or else— *bzzzt!*"

He even made crackling sound effects with his mouth and mimicked shooting lightning with his hands. The first-years barely held back their laughter, covering their mouths. Meanwhile, Eliana and Chelsea burst out laughing, clutching their stomachs, while Chloe sighed and buried her face in her hands.

"I told you to stop doing that ridiculous impression of Senior Duran."

"Why? I thoroughly analyzed our dear prince's mannerisms and behavior to perfect it," Carl said smugly.

"Why would you bother analyzing Senior Duran?" Juen asked, baffled.

"When we were first-years, our class was rivals with Duran's class," Chelsea explained, still giggling. "One day, Senior Carl decided that if he studied the behavioral patterns of notable figures in Class 1, he'd be able to predict their actions. He even has a Celia Zerdinger impression, and it's hilarious."

Hearing that, Carl straightened his back, ran his fingers through his hair in an exaggeratedly elegant motion, and spoke in Celia's voice, "Duran, don't cause unnecessary damage to the city. *Hmph.* Don't order me around, Celia Zerdinger."

Now fully committed to his act, Carl switched back and forth between both voices, playing both roles. The first-years couldn't hold back any longer and exploded with laughter.

Carl's impressions were strangely realistic yet comically off, making them even funnier. He could even do a Chloe impression, but he had once performed it in front of her and ended up encased in ice, so he wisely refrained.

Austin, a fellow knight from the Zerdinger family, smiled wryly, while Luke, who saw all seniors as near-holy figures, looked utterly lost on how to react.

"Agh! This is killing me! Hahaha!" Eliana howled with laughter.

"Is that so funny, Eliana Raden?"

The cold voice from behind made Eliana freeze. The others, who had been laughing, fell silent instantly. Only Chelsea was still chuckling, clutching her stomach.

"Well, well. It seems the first-year magic students have no respect for their senior knights," Celia said, stepping forward, flipping her hair back with a smirk.

Juen and Betty instantly went pale. Different department or not, a senior was still a senior. And Celia and Duran weren't just any seniors—they were among the top three in the second-year knight division. Getting on their bad side could make school life miserable.

"Um... well... this is, um..." Sweating profusely, Carl scrambled for an excuse.

"Let it go," a soft voice cut in.

It was Chen Xia, standing beside Leo, covering her mouth as she chuckled. Celia and Duran turned to look at her.

"He was just trying to lighten the mood, wasn't he?" she said, her tone warm yet composed. "I don't believe Celia and Senior Duran are the type to make a fuss over something so trivial."

Her mature smile soothed the tension.

"Yeah, you're seniors. You should let it slide," Leo added.

Celia sighed and flipped her hair again. "If you say so, Leo."

Duran, on the other hand, shot Carl a chilling glance before letting out a scoff.

Carl exhaled in relief. "That was close..."

"I told you not to do it," Chloe muttered, shaking her head.

Meanwhile, Leo approached Celia and Duran. "I heard there's something strange happening in the Monster Forest."

"Hmph. Your information network is fast," Duran said, smirking.

Celia nodded. "Perfect timing, actually. We were planning to request the top-ranked students to come to Dovela."

"Celia, did you really find traces of a Hero Dungeon in the Monster Forest?" Chloe asked.

Celia nodded. "Yeah. And while it's not confirmed yet, I don't think there's just one."

"What?"

"Let's head to our base first. We'll share what we've discovered there."

"Whose idea was it to use the lord's castle as a base?"

"Mine."

"Figures."

"Got a problem with it, Carl?"

"Nah, not really." Carl clasped his hands behind his head and answered lazily.

Duran scoffed and jerked his chin toward him. "Carl. Bring Chloe, Leo Plov, Chen Xia, and Chelsea Lewellin to the conference room."

"Yeah, yeah, I'll follow orders. What about Eliana?"

"Hmph. I suppose Eliana Raden qualifies as well."

Leaving those words behind, Duran strode off.

Juen, watching the exchange, pouted. "Senior Carl, why are you just accepting the way Senior Duran orders you around like a servant?"

"What can I do? That's just the way he is. He treats everyone like that, not just me. He *is* a prince, after all."

"Even so! You're one of the people who conquered Dweno's Hero Record! Shouldn't he at least show you more respect?"

Juen's indignant outburst was met with Haviden, Duran's mentee, passing by with a smirk.

"Even Senior Carl has to bow to Senior Duran. That's just common sense."

"What do you mean, 'bow to him'?" Juen snapped.

Carl, however, simply nodded. "He's got a point."

"I won't accept this!"

Juen and Haviden, both fierce competitors for the rank of second among first-years, immediately started bickering. They were well-known for constantly clashing, a reflection of the traditional rivalry between the magic and knight departments.

Martina sighed and turned to Austin, another knight from Leo's platoon. "Austin, you're friends with both of them. Can't you stop them?"

"It's pointless," Austin muttered with a sigh.

Carl, watching them with an amused grin, said, "Ah, to be young. That's youth for you."

"How old do you think you are?" Leo asked, stepping into the room with a smirk.

Carl grinned. "I was just copying you."

Leo chuckled. "Perfect timing. Duran told us to head to the conference room."

"Got it. What about you?"

"Aru and the Azonia students are arriving soon," Leo said calmly. "We'll need their cooperation for this."

{sep}

Leo met the Azonia students an hour after leaving the lord's castle.

At the warp gate, he explained the situation, and the Azonia representatives who had come to Dovela wore serious expressions.

"Leo Plov, are you saying there may be multiple Hero Dungeons?" Ruwen, a fox beastman and Azonia's third-ranked second-year, narrowed her eyes.

"Yeah."

"A massive battle awaits us! My heart is pounding!" Borman grinned.

"You only ever think about rampaging, idiot," Ruwen retorted.

"You damn fox...!"

Just as Borman bared his teeth, ready to argue, Dion, the second-ranked wolf beastman, cut in coldly. "Save the fight for later."

Ruwen and Borman scoffed but fell silent.

"It's troubling, though," Tavon muttered. "To have to reveal Azonia's disgrace to Lumene."

At his words, Ruwen and Borman stiffened. Even Dion let out a quiet sigh.

Watching them, Aru spoke up. "I already told you. Black Rabbit already knows."

The disgrace Tavon referred to, the one Azonia wanted to keep hidden, was deeply tied to why the Azonia students had come to Aleham.

Their real mission was to track down Hero Hunters discovered in the region.

This year, Azonia had launched a large-scale pursuit of Hero Hunters. As one of the great pillars of the world, alongside Lumene, they were putting their full force into hunting down Hero Hunters who could shapeshift at will.

To Azonia, they were an existence that should be erased from the world.

It had been 5,000 years since the Age of Heroes began.

For centuries, beastmen had revered the Brave Hero Aaron, claiming to be his descendants.

Yet, in all that time, not a single beastman—except for Aru—had ever been able to shapeshift freely without the full moon.

Even Azonia, the founder of their school, had been incapable of it.

But Hero Hunters—outsiders, criminals—could shapeshift at will, even without the full moon?

To Azonia, this was an unbearable truth.

The four students here had been deeply shaken when they first learned of it.

Now, working with Lumene meant the truth would inevitably come to light.

"The difference between a secret known by a few and one known by many is vast," Ruwen said, her voice heavy. "I think handling this ourselves is the only way to protect Azonia's honor."

"But if we work together, we can definitely track them down and—"

"Aru, you're only saying that because *you* can afford to," Ruwen interrupted.

"What?"

She met Aru's blue eyes head-on.

"You, who can shapeshift like Aaron himself, will never understand how we feel."

Aru looked taken aback.

Leo silently observed the Azonia students. Except for Aru, they were completely demoralized.

This wasn't the Azonia he knew. Azonia students were always brimming with confidence. They genuinely revered Aaron and tirelessly trained to become like the idealized Aaron they believed in.

But now...

*It looks like they've hit a wall thanks to Aru.*

Their spirits were crushed.

*No, they're not just discouraged. They've completely lost their fighting will.*

Not long ago, they had been obsessed with surpassing Aru, challenging her at every turn.

Now, their determination had vanished.

Leo suddenly chuckled.

"What's so funny, Leo Plov?" Tavon frowned.

Leo smirked. "You guys."

"What about us?"

"Yeah, what?"

The Azonia representatives looked confused, while Aru's expression stiffened.

"Hey, Black Rabbit! Wait—!"

"You look just like Aaron," Leo said. "Completely broken, like a bunch of cowards."
