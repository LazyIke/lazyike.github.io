Len Hors had been renowned as a prodigy in magic since his days as a student at Lumene. Due to his lack of Hero Dungeon conquests and external activities, he had never achieved the feat of having his name recorded in the Hero Record, so he wasn't widely recognized by the general public.

However, within the academic world of magic, his reputation and influence surpassed even those of the hero magicians whose names were inscribed in the Hero Record. He had developed numerous groundbreaking magic theories and published corresponding theses. Recognized for his genius, he became a professor at the hero academy Lumene at a young age, and within just a few years, he was regarded as the greatest professor in the magic department.

Len had no doubt that the second-year students, hailed as the golden generation, would become his greatest pupils. Chloe and Abad, both magic students, were the most promising mages he had ever encountered. Chelsea, too, was an exceptionally bright and resourceful student who had captured his attention.

And then there was Leo.

Leo didn't just understand ten things when taught one—he absorbed everything, making it his own, as if evolving. Len firmly believed that Leo would become the greatest magician since the Nebula Pioneer, Luna.

But... but!

*How could I have missed the most important event for the second-years! The Exclusive Smith Contract Workshop!*

For Len, it was a devastating shock. He prided himself on knowing the second-year students better than anyone. He believed he was close to them because he never hesitated to offer guidance. Yet, he had been pushed aside by a newly appointed professor!

From that day on, Len had assigned self-study to the first-years and spent two weeks desperately waiting for the second-years to return. He hoped his beloved students would seek his advice on crafting magic staves. He wanted to hear them say, *"We truly need Professor Len!"*

But instead—

"I'm so glad we had Professor Mel. She gave us advice on things I hadn't even considered."

"She's not even our assigned professor, yet she understood us perfectly and gave us the best possible guidance."

"Yeah, yeah. And she gave us cookies, too! The first-year magic students are so lucky—they get to eat those delicious cookies every lesson."

Chloe, Chelsea, and Eliana chatted as they walked by. Their words were enough to shatter Len's spirit.

"So the second-years don't even need me! Hahaha! In the end, Professor Mel is a better teacher than I am! That's why my students envy the first-years! Ahahahaha! Uwaaaaahhh!"

Throwing his head back, Professor Len let out a crazed laugh before collapsing onto his desk and sobbing.

Watching him, Anna pressed her fingers against her temples. "Professor Len, how many times must I tell you? The girls were only envious because of Professor Mel's cookies. The second-years still need you."

"I'm a teacher less valuable than a cookie!"

"How many times do I have to explain this for you to understand?!"

"*Sniff, sniff...* Assistant Professor Anna! You'll abandon me too, won't you? You'll run off to Professor Mel!"

"Why would I abandon you? I respect you, Professor Len." Anna sighed, giving him a wry smile.

"I've always wanted to work under you, Professor Len."

"Assistant Professor Anna..."

Len slowly lifted his head to look at her.

"Are you planning to stay single for the rest of your life? Well, considering your personality—"

Anna, expressionless, grabbed an empty bottle and turned it upside down.

Luke, alarmed, clung to her arm. "P-Please calm down!"

"Let go. I'm going to kill him."

Luke barely managed to restrain the ice-cold Anna.

"As you can see, this is his current state."

After regaining some composure, Anna released the bottle and clutched her forehead.

Leo watched and spoke. "Professor Len."

"Leo...?" Professor Len looked up at him.

"What brings you here?"

"I came to seek your advice, Professor Len."

"You want my advice?" Len let out a bitter laugh. "Wouldn't it be better to ask Professor Mel instead? Surely, she's superior to me."

"That might be true."

Anna looked at Leo in horror. Considering how dejected Professor Len already was, Leo's words would surely be a critical hit.

"Professor Mel is certainly excellent at building rapport. And she teaches magic theory well."

"Uwooooh! That's right! As an educator, she's one step ahead of me! Uhohohohoho!"

That was undeniable. No matter how much of a genius Len was, his opponent was the Dragon Lord. Their lifespans weren't even comparable. As Len sank further into self-pity, Leo spoke.

"But I believe that the second-years need the experience and expertise you've gained as a researcher, Professor Len."

"...!"

"A professor's role isn't just to teach. It's also to forge a path for students to follow."

These weren't just empty words. Professor Mel was superior in teaching students, but when it came to pioneering new magic theories, Len was undoubtedly a genius. Even the *Introduction to Stellar Magic*, which had been created using Leo's Bible, was proof of Len's extraordinary talent.

*If Luna had seen it, she would have been thrilled.*

As Leo thought to himself, Len hung his head, his shoulders trembling.

*Crash!* *Shatter!* *Clatter!*

Then, with a sweep of his arm, he knocked all the bottles off his desk.

"Yes! I've been a fool!"

Len, now invigorated, erupted into a frenzy.

"I wasted two whole weeks on useless thoughts! I still have a long way to go! A long way! Uhohohoho! Hahahahahahaha! But thanks to you, Leo! Thanks to you, I've reached a new realization! Hahahahahaha!"

As Len grabbed his face and laughed maniacally, Luke recoiled in fear. "H-He's okay... right?"

"He doesn't look okay, but at least it's better than him drowning in alcohol and acting like a wreck," Anna spoke coldly before glancing at Leo with a soft smile.

"Thank you, Leo. Thanks to you, Professor Len has regained his energy."

"I have a friend with a similar mindset when it comes to magic."

"Wait, do we actually have such an insane... no, such an unhinged student at this academy?"

"He's not a Lumene student."

"Then I never want to meet him."

Anna shook her head. Of course, the friend Leo referred to was none other than Luna.

At that moment, Len suddenly raised his voice. "So, Leo! What is it that you wanted to consult me about?"

At Len's question, Leo brought Luke forward.

"Hm? A first-year? And in the knight department, no less." Len's expression turned indifferent. "Why is he here?"

"He has talent as a magician as well."

"Hmm?" Len stroked his chin thoughtfully.

Meanwhile, Anna used magic to clean up Len's trashed office. Shattered bottles returned to their original state. Even the spilled contents flowed neatly back inside.

Luke, watching, gasped in amazement. "Magic is incredible."

"Oh? Not bad for a knight student." Len nodded in satisfaction. "Alright, what's your name?"

"My name is Luke Eldar."

"Luke, huh? Well, since you seem to have an open mind for a knight student, I suppose I can give you a lecture on magic."

Clearing his throat, Len spread his arms dramatically. "Magic is the act of understanding the fundamental laws of the universe and intervening in them! We magicians are the great seekers of these truths! Do you know why the stars shine in the night sky?"

"Umm... because they shine?"

"Because they shine, they shine... How philosophical! Good! Now I understand your way of thinking—"

"Alright, that's enough. If you start your magic introduction speech, we'll be here all day."

Anna prodded Len with her broomstick. The broom, now freed from her grip, began cleaning on its own.

Len nodded and crossed his arms. "Alright, I acknowledge that Luke has magical aptitude. So?"

"I'd like to teach him magic."

"Leo, I understand that you want to take care of your mentee, but asking a professor to personally tutor him is a bit..." Anna looked troubled.

Len also nodded in agreement. "It's true that I care about Leo, but I also dedicate a lot of time to researching magic theory."

Leo patted Luke's head as he looked at Len and said, "I'm not asking you to teach him magic. I want to consult you about how to introduce him to magic in a way that suits his mana trait."

"Oh? If you're saying that, then he must have a rare mana trait. What is it?"

"He's a natural mana amplifier."

"What did you say?"

Len's expression changed instantly. Anna's eyes also widened.

"He can amplify his mana based on his emotions."

"Can you show me?"

At Len's question, Luke hesitated for a moment before raising his aura. A few seconds later, he closed his eyes and focused.

*Vwoom—!*

Seeing Luke's aura swell, Len let out a gasp of admiration. For a brief moment, Luke's aura expanded drastically.

"So, the stronger his emotions, the greater his amplification?"

"Yes."

"Incredible! Truly incredible! Can this apply to mana as well?"

"He hasn't awakened his mana yet, so we haven't tested it. But I assume it will work the same way."

"Magnificent!"

Len's eyes sparkled. This was something worth researching. The ability to amplify mana at will was one of the most coveted skills for any magician.

"But even if he has the aptitude for magic, awakening mana isn't easy, especially since he's already trained in aura," Anna said regretfully.

Leo chuckled. "That's not something to worry about. This guy awakened aura on his own without any proper training method. His mana sensitivity should be more than sufficient."

"...He self-taught himself aura and still got into Lumene?"

"I was lucky." Luke scratched the back of his head awkwardly.

"Hmm. I see now." Len nodded. "Luke, from today onward, you should drop out of the knight department."

"Huh?"

"Transfer to the magic department."

"W-Wait, what...?"

"Are you seriously going to waste such an incredible talent by becoming some lowly knight?!"

"Eek?!"

Luke flinched at Len's fierce glare.

"Your ability is something all magicians dream of! It can't be allowed to rot away in that sweaty, muscle-brained knight department! Drop out immediately and transfer to the magic department! You and I will research your mana trait together!"

"T-That's..."

"Uhohoho! How wonderful! A new research subject has come to me! Hahahaha! What a fantastic day! Shall we start by awakening your mana right now?!"

As Len began to spiral out of control, Anna spoke up. "I understand what you're aiming for, Leo. Professor Len is clearly fixated on Luke's mana trait, so he'll probably research the best way for Luke to develop his magic to maximize his ability."

Anna narrowed her eyes. "You're quite cunning, Leo."

"I simply trust Professor Len's passion as a magician."

"Sure. Let's go with that. But..." Anna let out a deep sigh. "If we stay here any longer, Professor Len might try to dissect Luke. We should leave for today."

Luke let out a bright laugh. "Come on, that's a bit much."

But Anna didn't laugh.

"If it's him, I wouldn't put it past him."

Luke's face turned pale.

The next day, during joint combat class, the second-year students gathered at the training grounds according to their dormitories. The instructor in charge of today's class was none other than Harrid.

With his usual uninterested expression, Harrid announced, "Sedgen is busy today, so I'm here in his place. And today, I'll be announcing the format of your midterm combat exam."

The students began to murmur among themselves.

"Just so you know, the combat practical will be the only practical exam this time."

In other words, the only practical exam they had was for combat studies.

"Is it a Hero World conquest like in our first year?" Eliana raised her hand and asked.

In their first year, many of their midterm combat exams had involved Hero World conquests.

"No. This time, it's a mock battle."

"A mock battle?"

"That's right." Harrid looked over the second-years, who were giving him puzzled expressions, and continued, "It will be a large-scale mock battle in the form of a dormitory competition."

The second-years' eyes widened in shock.
