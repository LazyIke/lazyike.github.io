*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

Leo drummed his fingers on the desk.  

*So that's why Sylord has remained in Fairyland all this time.*  

A fragment of Erebos, sealed by the Hero of the Beginning, Kyle. An eternal, ever-burning calamity.  

[Kyle, after you ended the Age of Calamity, I discovered one of Erebos's fragments.]  

Sylord let out a deep sigh.  

[I was the only one in this world who knew of its existence.]  

There was no way he could have left it unattended. If Tartaros had found that fragment, the world would have once again been consumed by disaster.  

[I relocated Fairyland and established a new land. Deep underground, I sealed Erebos's fragment and have been suppressing it to prevent its awakening.]  

And thus, five thousand years passed.  

"Is there any sign of it waking up?"  

[Not at the moment.]  

Leo nodded. At least that was a relief.  

*But it's still a ticking time bomb.*  

His eyes narrowed.  

Five thousand years ago, during the final battle, sealing Erebos had been the only option Kyle had.  

*But now, we can track down and eliminate each fragment one by one.*  

The first had already been held back by the Heroes of Dawn.  

"One day, we'll destroy Erebos completely and finally achieve peace—the world they wished for."  

He turned to Sylord.  

"You've carried this burden alone for five thousand years...Thank you."  

The Nebula Pioneer Luna's pact spirit. But back then, he had been just a young fairy.  

Leo could only imagine how much emotional strain this small, kind-hearted being had endured over the millennia. Having faced Erebos directly, the terror he must have felt would have been overwhelming.  

At Leo's words, Sylord responded.  

[Kyle, I still regret leaving Luna behind five thousand years ago.]  

"It wasn't your fault."  

[I know. But if I had been a little braver, if I had stepped forward instead of Luna despite my inexperience...maybe she would have survived.]  

"......"  

[In the end, I was the only one who survived among those who went to defeat Erebos. So it was my duty—something I *had* to do.]  

Sylord's voice was steady and resolute.  

[So don't thank me. You're the one who deserves gratitude, not the one who should be giving it.]  

A bright smile followed.  

[You're the Great Hero who saved the world, after all.]  

"...Five thousand years really is a long time." Leo propped his chin on his hand. "That little fairy sure has grown up."  

[When you've been ruling for five thousand years, you gain some experience.]  

Leo smirked.  

"Right, to the point where you can kick out your own troublemaking son without hesitation."  

[A troublemaking son?]  

Sylord frowned as Leo reached into the air.  

A summoning circle opened.  

Normally, the moment the circle activated, Kiran would have come bounding through. But this time, he didn't.  

Leo shoved his hand into the summoning circle, grabbed something, and yanked it out.  

*Squeeze.*  

*...Something fluffy?*  

A small red chick popped out.  

[Pii.]  

Leo placed Fiora on the desk, then reached back into the summoning circle.  

*Squeeze.*  

"Aah, Master's rough touch~"  

A suspiciously pleased voice.  

Leo yanked Arty out and dumped her onto the floor.  

Annoyance flashed across his face.  

[Let go! I said let go!]  

[What kind of spirit beast refuses a contract call from their pact-maker?]  

With a cluck of her tongue, Elsie dragged Kiran through the summoning circle, completely bound in shadow.  

[Elsie?]  

Sylord's eyes widened as he looked at her.  

Elsie lifted the hem of her skirt slightly and bowed politely.  

[It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Majesty the Fairy King. I am Elsie, a spirit of shadow.]  

[By the heavens, how is Elsie here in the present era?]  

Sylord, taken aback, flew closer and examined her. Elsie tilted her head, then smiled.  

[Ah, so you knew another version of me?]  

[Another version?]  

Sylord studied her closely.  

There was no mistake.  

She was the same shadow spirit, Elsie, who had once been contracted to Kyle five thousand years ago. The one who had perished in battle against the Lord of the Dead.  

But something was different.  

The Elsie he remembered had always carried a heavy, brooding air. She had questioned their mission to save the world, shrouded in an impenetrable gloom.  

But this Elsie... 

[I came to this era through the Hero Record.]  

[The Hero Record?]  

[Yes, I was Leo's conquest reward.]  

Sylord's expression stiffened.  

To think that a past existence could be summoned into the present through the Hero Record.  

[Truly, the final legacy left behind by the gods.]  

As someone who remembered the age when gods still walked the earth, Sylord muttered in awe.  

Then, his gaze flicked toward Kiran, still restrained.  

Kiran quickly averted his eyes.  

[I never expected *you* to be Kyle's contractee, Kiran.]  

The weight of Sylord's presence bore down upon him, and Elsie finally released him from her Shadows.  

*Snap.*  

Kiran scrambled forward and knelt before Sylord.  

Then, with great reverence, he spoke.  

[Father, have you been well? It is an honor to see your esteemed face again after so long.]  

He bowed deeply, pressing his forehead to the ground.  

Leo propped his chin on his hand, watching in amusement.  

[With that said, Father, I have deeply reflected on my actions!]  

Kiran clenched his fist and declared with conviction.  

[I no longer cause trouble! Every day, I dedicate myself entirely to assisting Leo and working for the future of the world!]  

[...He didn't even hesitate to lie through his teeth.]  

Elsie leaned close and whispered into Leo's ear.  

Leo let out a dry chuckle.
[Is that true?]  

[Yes! I even helped defeat the Queen of Monsters!]  

Kiran declared proudly. Sylord turned to look at Leo.  

"Well, considering he's been with me, it's true he's accomplished some great feats."  

At Leo's words, Kiran flashed a good-natured smile.  

[Pii!]  

Fiora, still in chick form, made a gagging motion at Kiran's display.  

[You're surprisingly cooperative in helping Kiran out.]  

Elsie tilted her head.  

Leo remained indifferent.  

"There are plenty of others who'd rat him out even if I didn't."  

[Pii. Pii.]  

Fiora waddled over to Leo, then turned toward Elsie, chirping in curiosity. She seemed to be wondering why that troublemaker fairy was acting all innocent in front of Sylord.  

Elsie answered matter-of-factly.  

[Right now, Kiran is begging His Majesty the Fairy King for forgiveness, pretending he's turned over a new leaf.]  

Fiora's eyes widened. Then, as if rolling forward, she scurried up to Sylord.  

[Pik! Pik! Pik! Pik! Pik!]  

She flapped her tiny wings wildly, desperately trying to relay something to Sylord.  

Kiran's face twitched.  

Sylord, using magic, transformed Fiora into her human form.  

Now standing properly, Fiora greeted Sylord with polite courtesy.  

"I am Fiora, a phoenix. Sir, I have come to report this fairy's misdeeds."  

[Tell me, young phoenix.]  

"This vile fairy starts his day by stealing my snacks! Then, he spends the rest of it scheming ways to prank the diligent students of Lumene's Hero Academy!"  

Sylord's expression grew colder, while Kiran's face turned deathly pale.  

"And finally, he ends his day by stealing Lumene students' late-night snacks! He's an incorrigible menace!"  

Fiora, looking thoroughly satisfied, finished tattling on Kiran's daily routine.  

"And also—!"  

"Okay, okay, that's enough, Fiora."  

Arty stepped in, lifting Fiora by the underarms and carrying her off to a corner of the room. Fiora struggled, determined to say more, but when Arty shoved a lollipop into her mouth, she finally quieted down.  

[Seems like he still has a long way to go before he matures.]  

[F-Father...!]  

[The exile from Fairyland shall remain in effect.]  

Kiran collapsed in despair.  

Elsie sighed.  

[That's why you should behave yourself from the start.]  

After delivering her sharp rebuke, she flew over to Fiora, who was happily sucking on her candy.  

[Fiora, you're at fault too.]  

While Elsie disciplined the summoned beasts, Sylord flew over to Leo.  

[You're never bored, are you?]  

"I can't say I am."  

Leo chuckled.  

"You can't leave Fairyland for too long, can you?"  

[No. As much as I'd love to talk more, we'll have to save that for another time.]  

Leo nodded at Sylord's words.  

[Kyle, I'm truly glad to see you again.]  

"Same here."  

[Do you have a goal in this life?]  

Sylord knew. Back when Leo was Kyle, he had never had a clear purpose.  

At the question, Leo smirked.  

"I don't know how I was reincarnated, but there must be a reason for it."  

He met Sylord's gaze.  

"You and I, we both lived through the Age of Calamity. Now that I've been reborn and seen a world that has regained peace, it really makes me think...Even though I wandered without a clear purpose, simply following Lysinas and journeying with my friends, our efforts weren't meaningless after all."  

[It was the greatest achievement in history.]  

"So this time, I've set a clear goal for myself."  

Leo glanced at Fiora, Kiran, Arty, and then at Lea, still asleep on the bed. Finally, he looked out the window at the view beyond.  

"No matter what it takes, I'm going to settle the past in this lifetime."  Leo smiled faintly.  "The fear of the Primordial Evil...This time, I'm ending it for good. That's my goal."  

{sep}  

The next morning, Lea's eyes shot open.  

*This place...Huh?!*  

She bolted upright, cupping her cheeks, panic setting in.  

*I was summoning His Majesty the Fairy King, then passed out from mana depletion...and I ended up sleeping in Senior Plov's room?!*  

Lea scrambled out of bed, flustered, only to freeze when she spotted Leo sleeping in a chair by the window.  

"Senior Plov...So, um—"  

"You're awake?"  

Leo cracked one eye open and stretched.  

"Sorry for making you overexert yourself."  

"N-No, I should be the one apologizing for collapsing so pathetically..."  

Lea gave a sheepish laugh, scratching her head.  

Leo spoke casually.  

"I tried waking you, but you wouldn't budge, and I didn't know which room was yours, so I let you sleep here. Nothing happened, so don't worry."  

"Y-Yes!"  

Lea answered stiffly, though her heart was inexplicably racing.  

*Haaah! This is a serious violation of school rules!*  

Judging from the light outside, there was still some time before morning assembly.  

"I should hurry back."  

"Ah, it'd be better if you didn't leave just yet—"  

Before Leo could finish, Lea, still barefoot, had already rushed out the door.  

*Click—creak.*  

Carefully stepping into the hallway, she began making her way back to the dorms.  

"Lea?"  

She froze at the familiar voice behind her.  

Turning around, her eyes met those of Eclair, her close friend and the third-ranked first-year representative.  

"E-Eclair, this is, um—"  

Eclair's mouth opened and closed, unable to form words.  

"Lea...Did you just spend the night out? And in a *boy's* room?"  

"T-That's not it! Just come with me, I'll explain!"  

Lea grabbed Eclair's wrist and dragged her back toward Leo's room.  

*Creak.*  

Leo sighed as he opened the door.  

"I told you not to go out."  

Clicking his tongue, he turned his head slightly.  

"You're just going to keep hiding back there?"  

At his words, a flustered presence stirred. A moment later, Angel peeked out from the end of the hall.  

"Y-You...What's your relationship with Lea Tingel?"  

Her face was red as she questioned him.  

Leo, unfazed, responded flatly.  

"We just talked about summoning magic, that's all."  

His tone was matter-of-fact, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.  

Angel laughed awkwardly.  

"R-Right, of course."  

"What on earth were you imagining? Why are elves these days so quick to jump to conclusions?"  

"I-I *wasn't* jumping to conclusions!"  

Angel snapped, flustered.
