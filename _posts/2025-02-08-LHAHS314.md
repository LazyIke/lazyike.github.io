"Did you hear?"

"Yeah. The second-year seniors have been staying out overnight every day lately."

"They say it's a dormitory battle mock war. With the entire second-year participating, the scale must be insane."

"When do we get to do a large-scale mock battle like that?"

During the break in their joint combat class, first-year students gathered in small groups, chatting amongst themselves. It was their first midterm since entering Lumene, and the pressure was mounting. However, compared to previous years, they had it easier.

The first semester midterms were notoriously known as the doorstep of death for first-years. Normally, many would be recommended to withdraw by this point, but this year was different. Thanks to the newly implemented mentor system, not a single first-year would be forced to drop out before the semester ended.

That change gave them the rare luxury of watching their upperclassmen's midterm instead of worrying about their own survival.

"Hmph. Don't we feel like extras?" Juen muttered, sounding slightly irritated.

Typically, first-year midterms were the highlight of the semester. It was their moment to prove themselves, with the entire academy watching as they displayed their abilities.

But this time, all the attention was on the second-years.

Their full-scale mock war was so massive that even outsiders were coming to Lumeria City just to watch the so-called golden generation fight it out.

Fritz, a classmate, chuckled at Juen's complaint. "Isn't that obvious?"

"What?"

"Before the radiant brilliance of Senior Leo, we first-years naturally become extras..."

"Ah, yeah, yeah. It was my mistake asking a Leo Plov fanatic."

Juen sighed, shaking his head. Then, something occurred to him.

"I have a question. Why did you become Senior Abad's mentee? If you worship Senior Leo so much, shouldn't you have been his mentee?"

"What?! Someone like me, becoming Senior Leo's mentee?! That would be an insult of the highest order!"

"…You're seriously beyond help."

"Juen."

"What?"

"Your mentor is here."

"Huh? Senior Carl is here?"

Juen's eyes widened—then he burst into laughter.

"Seriously, even when he's busy, Senior Carl always makes sure to check on his adorable junior."

He stood up proudly, puffing out his chest. Envious gazes from nearby students immediately turned toward him.

Among the second-years, Carl was the most enthusiastic mentor.

But that wasn't why Juen was envied.

At the start of the year, Carl had been the most avoided senior. Despite his reputation as a tactical genius, his ranking was the lowest among the second-year combat students. Most first-years had thought Juen was crazy for choosing him as a mentor.

Some even whispered that Juen had only picked Carl because he was the heir to the Southern Magic Tower and didn't actually care about mentorship.

That opinion completely changed after Carl conquered Dweno's world.

When it was revealed that he had obtained Dweno's alchemy book as a conquest reward, admiration turned into jealousy.

With a spring in his step, Juen made his way toward the entrance of the training grounds—only to stop in his tracks.

A huge crowd had gathered.

And standing in the middle of it was Carl.

"Come one, come all! Senior Carl's General Store is open for business!"

Like a merchant in a bustling marketplace, Carl shouted cheerfully to the first-years.

Curious murmurs spread through the crowd.

"I have everything! From fatigue recovery potions to help with studying during exams! Candies! Portable training targets for combat practice! Sandbags! Treats for summons! Magic stones for spirits! You name it, I have it!"

Carl began placing various items onto a makeshift stall.

"And also! Emergency-use bombs! Throwing daggers! Antidote potions for status effects! Magic scrolls for emergencies!"

"Whoa!"

"This sounds amazing!"

The first-years' eyes sparkled with excitement.

Carl smirked. "And the best part."

With a dramatic flourish, he pulled out a card. On the back, decorated with Lumene Academy's emblem, was a photo of a second-year student.

"Premium customers will receive exclusive second-year handsome boys and beautiful girls collectible cards!"

"Whoa…!"

"Yes! It's Senior Nella!"

"Wow! Senior Abad!"

The first-years' excitement reached its peak.

"And these are from when they were still fresh-faced first-years!"

"Gulp…"

"I, I want one…!"

Faced with rare photos of their second-year seniors, the first-years hesitated.

"Hmph, how pathetic."

A cold voice cut through the air.

The crowd parted as Haviden stepped forward.

At his side was Rickiden Brick, a student from the Birson knight family who had attended Lumene a year earlier.

Having once dueled Carl, Rickiden greeted him with a smirk.

"Oh, Your Highness. You've graced this humble place with your presence."

Carl grinned as he greeted them back.

Haviden crossed his arms. "Senior Carl. This is the first-years' class break. Especially during combat class, visiting like this only disrupts the students' rest."

Carl sighed. "…You're just like your mentor. You look like the type to break the rules all the time, but you actually follow them to the letter."

Haviden frowned. "What are you implying?"

"It's a compliment. You're a model student."

Duran, Haviden's mentor, was strict about rules, even if he carried himself with an air of authority.

Haviden looked slightly displeased, but he didn't argue. "Anyway, you should pack up your stall."

Carl sighed dramatically. "You're so stiff."

"If you refuse, I will call Professor Harrid."

At that name, Carl visibly tensed.

Instead of arguing, he casually stepped closer to Haviden.

Haviden didn't flinch—until Carl subtly slipped something into his hands.

The card Carl had handed him featured Chelsea in her summer uniform, flashing a bright V-sign with her fingers.

"This is a win-win for both of us."

"Ugh…" Haviden's expression crumbled.

From a distance, Juen's expression turned cold.

"Oh! Juen! Want to buy something too?"

Carl spotted him and waved cheerfully.

Fritz, standing nearby, nudged Juen. "Juen Torvina. Senior Carl is calling you."

Juen responded icily. "I don't know that fool."

Then, he turned on his heel to leave.

Before he could escape, Carl caught up to him. "Wow! You even came to greet me! How admirable! How admirable!"

"Who are you?"

Juen pretended not to know him, but Carl simply grinned and pulled something from his pocket. "Here, here. Don't be mad. Take this."

Juen's eyes widened. The bullets were customized for his mana pattern—a perfect fit for his sniper magic.

"They're test samples. Close-range suppressive bullets and four-element bullets."

"You made these for me?"

Carl smirked. "Well, I am your mentor."

Juen beamed.

"Thanks, Senior!"

Then...

"So, did getting older just make you bolder, Carl Thomas?"

Carl's face turned pale.

Standing there, wearing a cold smile, was Professor Harrid.

"I'm sorry! I'm really sorry! I didn't mean to! Professor Harrid! I sincerely apologize!"

Carl bowed at a perfect 90-degree angle—again and again.

The first-years snickered at the sight.

Juen, however, averted his gaze.

"Juen, what were you talking about with Senior Carl?"

"Carl? Who's that? I don't know anyone by that name."

With an icy voice, Juen dismissed his classmate's question.
