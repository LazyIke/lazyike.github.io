In the height of summer, the warp gate flashed, and a boy with orange hair stepped out.

"It's definitely hotter here than in the central region."

Carl loosened his collar, fanning himself to ward off the heat, then raised his hand to shade his eyes as he looked up at the sky. The glaring sunlight bore down on him, making the summer heat all the more intense.

"It'd be nice if Chloe were here right now."

Thinking of the ice mage, Carl smacked his lips regretfully and glanced around. Back in his homeland, the Moira Kingdom, or in Lumeria City, it was easy to buy a cool drink or ice cream on the street during sweltering days like this.

*I guess it's because this is a rural kingdom? There's nothing like that here at all.*

Located in the central continent, the Moira Kingdom was small but served as a vital hub of commerce and transportation due to its massive population and trade routes. Meanwhile, Lumeria City was developed enough to be called the center of the world.

As a result, both places had well-established infrastructure, unlike here in the remote western kingdom of Dellad.

*I bet starting a business here would be a goldmine. This is still the capital, so there should be some money to go around, right?*

Carl surveyed the streets of the Dellad Kingdom capital Dellan, calculating. How much could he make if he spent the entire summer break earning money here?

He entertained the thought for a moment before letting out a small sigh.

*Too bad I won't be here for long.*

Clicking his tongue, Carl continued walking. Just then, a group of students wearing what looked like school uniforms rode through the street on horseback, moving as if escorting a carriage.

Carl noticed the flag on the carriage and stepped aside. Embroidered on it was the royal emblem of Dellan.

*A carriage carrying royalty, huh.*

Carl muttered internally and was about to walk away when a voice called out from the carriage.

"You there, the one with orange hair."

Turning around with a puzzled expression, Carl saw a boy around his age, also in a uniform, riding toward him.

"Yes? What is it?" he asked.

"How dare you block the path of the royal family?"

At the boy's words, Carl scratched his head. He had already moved aside to avoid obstructing the carriage. Since the boy still brought it up, it seemed Carl had gotten himself caught up in something troublesome.

"I'm from the central continent," Carl said with a polite smile. "I'm here as a tourist, so I'm not well-versed in the laws of this kingdom. Could you explain the proper etiquette when royalty passes by?"

"When a royal carriage passes, it is proper to move as far away as possible."

"Understood."

Each kingdom had its own customs. Rather than getting dragged into something annoying, Carl opted to play along.

Watching him, the boy—Gulliver—smirked. "Hmph. Even a commoner should study the customs of a country they visit. Consider yourself honored that I, the top student of Dellan Royal Academy, personally taught you proper etiquette."

"Much appreciated."

Carl grinned. There were always nobles like this, no matter where he went.

*Good thing the prince didn't come along.*

Carl thought of Duran, the crown prince of his home kingdom and his dormmate at Lumene Academy.

The day after summer break began, a letter had arrived for Carl in the morning. The sender? None other than the Dragon Queen.

He had been admiring the letter when, just as he was about to head to the kitchen for breakfast...

*Carl Thomas, you received an invitation too?*

Carl had nearly choked on his bread when Duran suddenly barged into the kitchen. His parents had been thrown into a frenzy at the unexpected visit from the crown prince so early in the morning.

Carl sighed internally, remembering how his family had kicked him out of his own seat, chattering about how this was an honor for their household, while Duran shamelessly enjoyed a lavish breakfast in his place.

> "Mom, what about my breakfast?"
>
> "You can eat after the crown prince has finished."

Grumbling to himself, Carl recalled the way Duran had casually taken over his house.

> "The Plov territory... Does that refer to the territory of Leo Plov's family?"
>
> "Most likely. But seriously, why couldn't you just contact me through magic? Why show up at my house first thing in the morning?"
>
> "Hmph. Only a select few received invitations. I've already confirmed with multiple people."

Duran had apparently spent the early morning using magic communication to verify the recipients. After gathering his information, he left just as abruptly as he had arrived.

Carl had nearly ended up traveling with him, but he had planned to visit Leo's place early to hang out before the other invited students arrived.

*If he had come with me, this place would be in chaos.*

Carl was thinking that when the carriage door suddenly opened.

The students escorting the carriage immediately dismounted and knelt. Even the student who had been acting superior just moments ago hurriedly knelt, glancing at Carl with a nervous look.

"The Crown Prince of the Dellad Kingdom has disembarked. Quickly..."

Before the student could finish talking, the Crown Prince asked, "Are you Lumene Academy's Carl Thomas? A friend of Sir Leo?"

Carl bowed in greeting. "Crown Prince Deven, is it? I trust you've been well."

The one who had stepped out was none other than Prince Deven of Dellad, whom Carl had met through Leo during the last summit.

Hearing the words "Lumene Academy," Gulliver, the student who had been acting high and mighty, widened his eyes in shock.

"It seems you're spending your break here in Dellan," Prince Deven said.

Carl smiled. "Yes, Leo invited me."

Though he was a commoner, he had a slick demeanor and, as a member of Noble, a dormitory for students from prestigious families, he was well-versed in noble etiquette.

Prince Deven studied Carl for a moment before nodding, then glanced at Gulliver with an apologetic expression. "I hope my academy's student hasn't caused you any trouble."

"If he didn't know, then I suppose it's understandable," Carl replied smoothly.

At that, Gulliver, still kneeling, went pale.

"Since we've met like this, allow me to escort you to the Plov estate," Deven offered.

"You don't have to go through the trouble."

"Don't refuse. Actually, there's something I'd like your opinion on."

"My opinion?"

"Yes, it concerns the Hero Record."

Carl's expression shifted slightly at the mention of the Hero Record.

"Recently, we've discovered several objects in our kingdom that we suspect to be fragments of the Hero Record. Today, I was transporting the selected items to the palace. As a Lumene Academy student, you must have encountered the Hero Record before, haven't you?" Prince Deven smiled. "I'd like you to take a look at them."

The Hero Record was a powerful artifact capable of altering the balance of nations just by being found. As a result, countless fakes circulated.

*Not like I can refuse a crown prince's request.*

Scratching his cheek, Carl replied, "I'm still just a student, so I wouldn't place too much trust in my judgment."

"That's not a concern."

Carl boarded the carriage. Inside, he spotted an ornate chest. 

As Prince Deven touched the magically sealed chest, a magic circle appeared.

*Click.*

With the sound of a lock opening, the chest was revealed to contain countless scraps of paper infused with mana.

*Just as I thought.*

Fragments of old magical texts or summoning scrolls, imbued with mana or spiritual energy, were often mistaken for Hero Records.

"Most Great Hero-related records are fragmented like that. Honestly, you should have an expert examine them instead," Carl said.

Prince Deven nodded. By then, the carriage had arrived at the Plov estate.

"If you get the chance, please visit the palace with Sir Leo."

"Thank you for your hospitality."

Carl bowed as the prince's carriage departed.

"Why were you riding in the crown prince's carriage?"

"Oh! Leo! How's your break going?"

Hearing the voice behind him, Carl greeted Leo with a grin.

"I just ran into him on the way here."

Shrugging, Carl watched Leo smirk and open the front gate.

"How's your break?"

"Not bad."

"Did you do your homework? Mind showing me what you've finished?"

"Go ahead."

"Man~ You're the best, buddy!"

Carl patted Leo on the back and walked inside.

Watching Carl's retreating figure, Leo sighed to himself. 

*You probably won't have time for homework, Carl.*

"Having one of Leo's school friends over is a first since that girl, Chelsea, visited."

That evening, Carl was warmly welcomed by Leo's parents, Dade and Reina.

"Thank you for your hospitality," Carl greeted Dade Plov politely.

"Hey, Carl. Doesn't Leo have any friends from the knight department? Only kids from the magic department come over, and it's a little disappointing," Reina said, cupping her cheeks with a regretful expression.

Carl replied, "There's Chen Xia and Eliana. But I guess Leo doesn't talk much about school life?"

"Yeah. Our son hardly ever talks about his friends," Reina clicked her tongue and asked, "Are you sure he doesn't have a girlfriend? He's the student council president, so I imagine he's quite popular."

"He doesn't have a girlfriend. But he is the most popular guy in the second year. He gets multiple love letters a day."

"Oh? Oh~."

Reina's eyes sparkled with interest as Carl went on to share stories about Leo's school life.

Leo simply smiled as he listened, prompting Reina to grumble, "Honestly, if you just sit there and watch, you really seem like an old man."

"Please call it being mature."

"There's a limit to how mature someone should be."

Shaking her head, Reina turned to Carl with a curious expression. "My son's nickname at school isn't something like 'old man,' is it? Hey, Carl, what do they call Leo at school?"

Carl answered nonchalantly, "The Demon King."

"The Demon King?"

"Yes, because of the overwhelming presence he showed during the midterms, everyone calls him 'Demon King Leo.'"

"How do you always end up with nicknames that have nothing to do with heroes?" Reina clicked her tongue in exasperation. 

"Anyway, you guys must have it tough. Instead of enjoying your break, you're stuck in a training camp," she added with sympathy, already aware of what awaited them.

"Well, it's good for building camaraderie. And it's not like we're going to some dangerous area—it's being held in the Plov territory. We'll have clean lodging and proper meals, at least."

*Oh, this kid still doesn't know.*

As the lady of the Plov household, Reina had already visited the training camp site chosen by the Dragon Queen. And she had seen the banner.

"Hey, Carl."

"Yes?"

"Eat more."

"Ah, I'm full, though."

"No, eat as much delicious food as you can while you still can."

Feeling uneasy under Reina's pitying gaze, Carl turned to Leo and asked, "Hey, Leo."

"What?"

"You have an idea of what this training camp is like, right? It's being held in your territory."

Out of all the places in the world, the Dragon Queen had chosen the Plov estate. It was likely that Leo's influence as the student council president and an all-class hero played a major role in that decision.

Since Leo was from the estate, Carl figured he'd have some insight.

In response to Carl's question, Leo silently picked up the main dish from his own plate and placed it onto Carl's.

Seeing that, Carl smiled sorrowfully.

*We're fucked.*
