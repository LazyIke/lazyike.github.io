"The Book of Shadows?!"

"That actually exists?"

On the first day of the summit, when the meeting concluded and the contents were formally announced, the students were left in shock.

What drew the most heated interest was the existence of the Book of Shadows.

As the entire dormitory cafeteria buzzed with surprise, Chloe turned to Chen Xia beside her. "Xia, did you know about this?"

"Yes." Chen Xia answered with her characteristic smile.

Eliana burst out, "Why didn't you say anything?! This is an incredible discovery! If people had known that Shadows could also be recorded in a Hero Record, those ignorant idiots wouldn't have looked down on you or treated you with contempt!"

Eliana reacted with excitement.

Among the students in the Glory dormitory and those who had been in the same first-year class as Chen Xia, her status as a Shadow had never been an issue.

Chen Xia herself, after resolving her internal conflicts with Leo's help, had decided not to be bound by the distinctions of hero or Shadow and to walk her own path.

However, as long as she was the princess of Xian, there were bound to be students who viewed her with prejudice.

A hero was defined as someone who accomplished a great feat recognized by the gods. But no matter how great a hero was, they were still human, and no human was perfect.

Some had committed grave mistakes, and some, despite their achievements, lacked noble character. There were even those who had done things worthy of condemnation. Yet, because they were recognized by the gods, people quickly forgot those faults.

On the other hand, Shadows, lacking divine recognition, were judged by an even harsher standard.

That said, no one in the second year openly disrespected Chen Xia.

Celia, who was in the same chivalry department, as well as the proud Duran, both regarded her as a rival. 

The top students in the magic department—Chloe, Chelsea, and Abad—were all close friends with her. 

In the summoning department, Eliza was one of the few who openly acknowledged Chen Xia as a formidable opponent, and Walden wasn't the type to care about such things in the first place.

Most importantly, she was a close friend of Leo, the student council president.

No one in Lumene was foolish enough to risk ruining their school life by offending the top students, but that didn't mean underlying perceptions could be changed overnight.

Chen Xia had simply chosen to ignore the subtle glances, opting not to confront them.

As fellow dormmates, Chloe and Eliana were well aware of this.

Watching Eliana clench her fists in frustration, Chloe let out a small sigh. "Since it was classified information in Xian, Xia probably couldn't talk about it freely. And even if the Book of Shadows' existence is revealed, things won't change overnight."

"Chloe is right. It's up to us Shadows to change how people see us."

"Still! The Dragon Queen outright declared that discrimination wouldn't be tolerated! If anyone dares to look at you like that, I'll beat them to a pulp."

"Thank you, Eliana." Chen Xia smiled warmly.

At that moment...

"Um... Chen Xia."

A hesitant voice called out.

Eiran approached nervously. A fellow second-year from Seiren, ranked second in her year.

"Yes, Eiran?"

"Since you're the princess of Xian, have you seen the Book of Shadows in person?"

"Of course."

"Then... have you read the records of the Hero of the Beginning?"

"Yes."

"Ahh, I'm so jealous!" Eiran, an avid hero enthusiast, exclaimed excitedly. "What kind of stories were recorded?"

Her eyes sparkled with anticipation. Chloe and Eliana, equally curious, turned their attention to Chen Xia.

The Hero of the Beginning, Kyle.

Until just a year ago, he had been dismissed as nothing more than a legend. However, with proof of his existence confirmed, scholars had been constantly reevaluating his legacy.

Yet, due to the lack of surviving records, research into his exploits had barely progressed.

Now, with his records discovered, it was only natural for hero candidates to take interest.

"What's all the excitement about?" Chelsea, carrying her tray of food, tilted her head in curiosity.

Chloe answered, "The Book of Shadows and the Hero of the Beginning."

"If that's the topic, count me in!"

Chelsea's eyes gleamed as she eagerly took a seat, then gestured to Abad. "Brother, come sit here!"

Chuckling, Abad took the seat beside her. "I'm curious too. What kind of magic did the Hero of the Beginning use? Was he really an all-class?"

"Yes."

As the conversation grew lively, Lunia, who was eating her meal at a distance, propped her chin on her hand. "Lumene never has a quiet day, does it?"

She shook her head slightly.

At that moment, Carl, Aru, and Drianna, who had been sitting nearby, stood up.

"Where are you going?"

"They're talking about the Hero of the Beginning! Aren't you curious?" Aru's eyes sparkled with excitement.

Lunia shook her head. "Not really."

"Leave the pointy-eared one alone. Even if she is curious, her pride won't let her admit it."

"Yeah. If we ignore her, she'll come on her own."

Drianna and Carl snickered as they followed Aru toward Chen Xia.

"I'm really not that interested..." Lunia muttered, unimpressed.

But every time an exciting part of the discussion came up, her ears twitched slightly.

"Ugh, damn it!"

Finally unable to hold back, she bolted toward the noisy gathering.

"The purpose of this summit is to break down the barriers between heroes and Shadows and strengthen cooperation," Melina said, seated in Mel's office. "And I also intend to reinforce harmony between the different races."

The world had long been entangled in complex interests, fostering distrust between nations, and between races as well.

Melina wanted to use her time as Dragon Queen to mend these divisions and unite as much strength as possible.

With the collapse of the Dawn Records approaching, the threat of Erebos was now imminent.

"Thanks to you, Leo, Rodia has gained a new power, so we've managed to buy some time, but..."

"That, too, is just delaying the inevitable," Leo said, lifting the teacup Melina had prepared and taking a sip.

Melina studied him. "What do you think of the heroes of this era?"

The heroes who had made it into a Hero Record in this age, they would undoubtedly become the forces that would stand against Erebos and Tartaros in the future.

"They're all impressive."

"Do you have any advice for them?"

"Well..." Leo's crimson eyes curved slightly. "No matter what anyone says, they've accomplished feats worthy of divine recognition and earned a place in a Hero Record."

After taking another sip, he placed the teacup down. "It would be ridiculous for me to give advice to people who are already standing on the stage and fulfilling their roles."

"Then..."

"I'm still more interested in the hero candidates who will lead the next generation. That's why I've made plans for this summer break."

"Plans?" Melina tilted her head.

Leo pulled a piece of paper from his coat and handed it to her. 

As she read through it, she spoke. "Hmm... A training schedule. You plan to do this?"

"That's right. Think of it as a sort of training camp. I'm planning to hold it on the Plov family's estate."

Hearing that, Melina smiled bitterly.

*These kids are about to experience hell during summer break.*

"I want to invite the people listed here as instructors. Could I ask for your help?"

"Of course. I'll take care of the preparations."

After nodding and tucking the schedule away, Melina asked, "Leo, I have a question for you."

"What is it?"

"How long do you intend to keep hiding that you're the reincarnation of the Hero of the Beginning?"

Leo crossed his arms and gazed at the ceiling in thought.

"Do you plan to keep it a secret forever?"

"No, not forever. Someday, I'll have to reveal it myself." After a brief moment of contemplation, Leo shook his head. "But now isn't the time. At the very least, I should only reveal it when I've gained enough power that I don't pale in comparison to my past self."

Although he was regaining his past strength at an incredible pace and steadily accumulating power through Hero World's conquest rewards, he had yet to fully reclaim his prime.

"Right."

The summit held in Lumene and the news that followed shook the world.

On the very first day, the existence of a Hero Record called the Book of Shadows was revealed, along with unknown details of the Great Heroes' final journey.

The next day, Melina stunned the world again by publicly disclosing the Hero Records of the heroes who had fought in the Jörmungandr subjugation—documents she had received from Leo.

While shocking events continued to unfold, the first-year final tournament progressed without pause.

And before anyone realized it, the semifinals had arrived.

"Wow, the president's mentee... That's crazy," Eliana clicked her tongue in amazement. "A guy ranked dead last in the grade made it to the semifinals? And his opponent is the class representative?"

Watching Eliana's eyes sparkle with excitement, Carl rested his chin on his hand. "You're having fun, aren't you?"

"Of course! Austin already secured his spot!"

Eliana's mentee and Leo's knight-in-training, Austin, had secured a passing rank. With no more worries about expulsion, Eliana could now fully enjoy the first-year duels.

"Plus, thanks to the president's mentee pulling off upset after upset, I won big on my bets!" She grinned as she shook her coin pouch. "I messed up my written exams, so I almost lost my allowance! But thanks to this, I won't have to worry about money for the next semester!"

Seeing Eliana's sheer excitement, Eiran, who had been quietly watching, murmured in admiration, "Amazing."

"Hu-hut! Call me the Heart of a Beast, Eliana!"

"That sounds so cool!"

"Don't encourage her, Eiran. That's not the heart of a beast, it's the brain of a brute," Chelsea, who had been clapping in admiration just moments ago, remarked coldly.

"Hmph. Anyway, should I grow this money even more? Carl, I want to buy a betting slip!"

"Yeah, yeah. Luke?"

"What are you talking about? Of course, Aina!"

"Huh? Haven't you been betting only on Luke this whole time?"

"Hah! A true gambler doesn't take unnecessary risks! Betting on a sure win, even if the payout is low, is the mark of a true professional!"

That was quite a statement coming from someone who had just called themselves the Heart of a Beast.

"How much are you putting down?"

"Everything."

Seeing the gleam of greed in Eliana's eyes, Carl handed over the betting slip without hesitation.

"Make me rich, my cute junior."

Just then...

"I'd like to place a bet as well."

Someone approached Carl.

It was none other than Lea.

After being dragged off by Harrid, her soul had been reduced to dust, but after a few days, she had barely managed to recover.

"Who are you betting on?"

"Aina Beidna. This much."

Lea handed Carl a stack of money. Unlike Eliana, whose eyes were filled with greed, Lea's burned with a different emotion.

Without a word, Carl accepted the bet.

*Not my money anyway.*

He stashed the cash into his dimensional pouch. "Time to get ready for business."

"Hoo..."

Right before stepping into the arena, Luke took a deep breath.

Leo was nowhere to be seen.

In fact, Leo hadn't visited Luke even once since his first match.

That was disappointing, but at the same time, another thought crossed his mind.

*Maybe this is Senior's way of saying I can do this on my own now.*

Thinking that, he gave himself a light slap on the cheek.

He calmed his racing heart.

For an entire semester, he had only been able to watch from a distance.

Someone he had thought of as nothing short of incredible was now waiting for him.

*How well can I do?*

The opponents he had faced so far were all formidable.

But this time, his opponent was on another level.

Quite literally, the strongest of the first-years.

Anxiety crept in, making his chest tighten.

But then, he took another deep breath and stepped forward.

*You can do it, Luke.*

He shook off his fear.

*It's time to test how far I've come against the strongest first-year.*
