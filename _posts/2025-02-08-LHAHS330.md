The evening after the exam, the second-year students changed into new outfits in their respective dormitories.

"Looking at this, our school is really ruthless," Eliana muttered as she fussed with her hair in front of a mirror in the Glory dormitory lounge. Dressed in an elegant party gown, she sighed as she took in her reflection.

A male student from the magic department gave her a puzzled look. "What are you talking about all of a sudden?"

"I mean, we were fighting so fiercely just a while ago. Winners and losers were clearly decided. But now, they're throwing a celebration party on the very same day?"

"True," another student nodded.

"To make things worse…"

One of the Glory students let out a deep sigh. "Today's victory… honestly, can we really say we won because we did well?"

At those words, the expressions of the Glory students darkened. It wasn't that they hadn't given it their all—if anything, they had fought with everything they had. With Harmony and Noble working together against them, Glory had been in constant danger.

Despite that, their victory had been secured only because Leo had taken down Harmony and Noble's kings, Chelsea and Carl.

As the Glory students sat gloomily in the lounge, the sound of footsteps echoed.

*Click-clack— Click-clack—*

"Why does everyone look so down?"

Seeing Chloe enter, murmurs of admiration spread through the room. As one of the most beautiful girls in the second year, Chloe had always been popular. But tonight, dressed in a striking party gown, her usual composed elegance had an almost dazzling allure.

Her platinum blonde hair, blue eyes, and sky-blue dress left a lasting impression.

"Chloe, you look stunning," a male student commented.

Dressed in the characteristic flowing attire of the Eastern Continent, Chen Xia appeared behind her, smiling brightly. "With the two most beautiful girls in our dorm all dressed up, this is quite a sight."

"There's definitely an exotic charm to it," another student added.

Eliana frowned, pointing at herself. "I'm a beauty too, you know."

"Uh, sure."

"Yeah, you're beautiful."

"What's with those lukewarm responses?!" Eliana's eyes flared in indignation.

Amidst the commotion, Chen Xia, now seated on the sofa, tilted her head. "By the way, what were you all talking about? Your expressions looked so gloomy."

At her question, the Glory students exchanged glances.

"Come on, tell this big sister," Chen Xia teased, smiling playfully.

Eliana slumped onto the sofa. "I mean, in this dorm battle… honestly, the captain practically carried the entire thing on his back." Leaning against the couch, she let out a long sigh. "It just feels like… is it really okay for us to fully enjoy the party?"

The other dormitory students wore similarly dejected expressions.

"Was everyone thinking the same thing?"

Chen Xia smiled, while Chloe crossed her arms. "It's true that Leo had the biggest impact in this battle. But he also said it himself, didn't he? That he wouldn't have been able to fight so freely without his dormmates."

"That's right. Leo said that he was able to perform because he had comrades he could rely on. So, there's no need to feel discouraged," Chen Xia added.

The Glory students' expressions lightened.

"He really said that?"

"Yes."

A few of them looked a little embarrassed.

"By the way, where's Leo?" someone asked.

Chloe replied, "He's probably already at the party."

The afterparty for the second-year midterm exam took place in the dormitory garden.

Though Glory, Harmony, and Noble had separate dorm buildings, they shared the same garden, allowing students to mingle freely. As gentle music played, the main seats were occupied by special guests—mostly the parents of the second-year students who had been invited to watch the exam.

"Professor, how is my son doing in school? He doesn't write much about his studies at Lumene in his letters."

"Student Toren has recently taken a great interest in researching how to alleviate droughts using water elementals," Sedgen replied with a warm smile. "Although he is an elemental user, he is also diligently attending magic lectures as a secondary field of study. His academic performance is outstanding. Professor Yura, why don't you come over and share more about Student Toren?"

Sedgen actively engaged with the parents, dragging along the other faculty members to relay stories about their students.

"Seeing this, Professor Sedgen really is impressive," Len remarked, having just finished a consultation with a magic student's parents.

"Well, there's a reason he's regarded as the best professor at Lumene," Harrid added dryly, sipping his wine.

"Uh, Mother?"

"Sister… why are you here?"

"Father!"

Surprised voices rang out near the entrance.

The second-year students who had just arrived at the party were discovering the special guests. Some were overjoyed, while others looked flustered. As they mingled with their families and introduced their close friends, the party quickly grew livelier.

Celia approached Chloe. "Celia, how's your body holding up?"

"I've already received full healing. What about you?"

"Same. It's just a shame we didn't get to properly fight it out."

The two close friends exchanged smiles.

Seeing this, Chen Xia chuckled. "I also regret not getting to finish my fight with Duran."

"Hmph, if we had continued, I would have won," Duran scoffed, walking up behind them.

Beside him stood a small girl, around ten years old, with golden hair and golden eyes.

Chen Xia squatted down and smiled. "And who is this adorable young lady?"

"My sister."

"Nice to meet you. What's your name?"

The girl hesitated before giving a shy smile. "I am Helen Moira. It's an honor to meet you. Your duel with my brother was truly spectacular."

"I'm honored that you think so, Princess Helen."

Since she was Duran's sister, that meant she was a princess of the Moira kingdom.

At Chen Xia's words, Helen beamed.

Watching this, Chloe and Celia exchanged glances before giving Duran a peculiar look.

"What?" he asked.

"Oh, nothing. Your little sister is adorable. But she doesn't really match your image," Chloe teased.

"Yeah, she seems a bit too good for you. Mind if I take her? I've always wanted a younger sister," Celia smirked.

Duran scoffed.

"Oh! Everyone's gathered here!" Carl's voice rang out. "Oh my, the princess is here as well!"

Seeing Helen, Carl exaggerated a bow. Since he was from Moira, it was only natural.

"Princess Helen, my name is Carl Thomas."

"Carl Thomas! Oh, I've heard a lot about you from my brother. You're from our kingdom, right? My brother once told me you're an exceptional magician."

Everyone was surprised. Duran had *praised* Carl in front of his sister? That was unexpected.

"…Who are you, and what have you done with the prince?"

"Shut up, Carl Thomas," Duran scoffed. "I just told her that even though your grades are terrible, I was impressed by how you kept struggling to survive."

Carl burst into laughter. "Now that's the prince I know!"

Chloe and Celia stifled their own laughter, while Duran maintained his usual blank expression.

Just then, a woman aproached them smiling.

"Oh my, Celia. Are these your friends?" Reina asked, glanging at Carl, Chloe, Chen Xia, and Duran. "So, you're students from the knight and magic departments? My child has been relying on you all."

Chloe quickly responded, "No, if anything, we've been the ones relying on Celia."

"You must be Chloe. I've heard a lot about you," Reina greeted warmly. "And you must be Carl? I've been hearing a lot of stories about you since last year."

"Stories? What stories?" Carl looked at Celia, somewhat surprised.

Seeing his reaction, Chen Xia chuckled. "Celia, you really take after your mother."

At that, Celia let out a dry laugh. "She's not my mother. She's my aunt."

"Aunt? Then…"

"She's Leo's mother."

"Our son has been relying on you all," Reina said warmly.

Chloe panicked. "N-no! I mean! From my first year! That is… I should say… I've received a lot of help from your son."

Reina laughed. "Alright, why don't you visit us during the summer?"

"By the way, where has that son of mine gone?" Reina muttered.

*Step— Step—*

[Leo! Hurry up! Faster!] Kiran whined as he clung to Leo's shoulder.

Clicking his tongue at the nagging, Leo stopped in front of Tina's office.

*Knock, knock—*

He knocked, but there was no response.

*…Did she go to the party?*

He frowned for a moment before shaking his head. From what he knew, Tina wasn't the type to attend social events.

"It looks like she's not here."

Even so, he turned the doorknob.

*Click— Creeeak—!*

The door opened with an eerie creak, the sound echoing down the hallway.

Leo peeked inside. "Professor Tina, are you in?"

[If she's not here, let's just grab it and run!]

"Say something reasonable."

[Why?! They're my wings!]

Just as Kiran was throwing a fit, a strange noise came from inside the office.

*Shhhk— Shhhk—*

Leo's expression hardened. Something was off. Ignoring Kiran's frantic tugging at his collar, he stepped further in.

"Leo! No! That psycho elf might have set up traps or something!"

Kiran's face was full of terror as he tried to hold him back, but Leo walked into the office without hesitation.

Light seeped through a slightly open door inside. He pushed it open. "Professor Tina, are you here?"

Inside, Tina was sharpening a scalpel against a whetstone.

Kiran's eyes widened in horror. [AAAAAAHHHHH!]

He thrashed wildly, trying to flee, but Leo grabbed him before he could escape.

"Hello, Leo." Tina stood up, still holding the scalpel. Her messy hair and eerily gleaming eyes made her look unhinged. "I watched the dorm battle. You did well."

She turned her gaze toward Kiran, examining him like a deranged researcher looking at a test subject.

"What brings you here?"

"This guy broke into your office earlier, didn't he?"

"Oh, so he's your contractee."

Tina nodded and snapped her fingers. The lights flickered on, illuminating the space.

Kiran, who had been mid-scream, suddenly let out a relieved sigh at the brighter room.

"So, Leo, I have a request." Tina smiled. "Can I dissect your spirit beast just once?"

[Hiiiik!]

"Please hold back."

"Really?" Tina clicked her tongue in disappointment. "So, why are you in my office?"

"The fairy wings you have actually belong to this guy." Leo lifted the still-struggling Kiran for her to see.

"Hmmm? And?"

"I was wondering if you could return them."

"Hm!" Tina folded her arms, contemplating. After a moment, she nodded. "Alright, sure. But in return, will you do me a favor?"

"I'm just a normal human. Cutting me open won't reveal anything special."

"That's tempting too. But no, that's not what I meant." Tina grinned. "Leo, what do you think about becoming an exchange student at Seiren?"
