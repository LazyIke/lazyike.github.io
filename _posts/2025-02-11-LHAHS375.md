"We came to gather information, but what exactly are we supposed to do now?"

At Chloe's question, everyone's gaze naturally turned to Carl.

Since their first year, Chloe, Chelsea, and Eliana had built a strong trust in Carl's information network. Even the first-years had heard his name countless times, and not just because their mentors were close to him.

At the beginning of his second year, Carl had been the weakest and lowest-ranked among his peers, so the first-years hadn't paid much attention to him. But now, Carl Thomas was one of the most frequently mentioned names among first-years, right after Leo and the top students in each department.

The reason was simple.

> "If you need information, find Carl Thomas." 

That was what the second-year mentors always said.

The current first-years were different from their predecessors.

Lumene operated under a survival system where those who lacked ability were forced to leave. However, first-years were granted a grace period during their first semester.

That didn't mean Lumene's competitive system changed. To receive better guidance and increase their survival chances after the first semester, students had to achieve high grades and leave strong impressions on their professors.

Lumene's grading system was complex. While absolute evaluations existed, relative assessments also played a role. To secure a professor's favor, students needed to tailor their approach to match each professor's teaching style.

Beyond that, predicting exam questions, preparing for practical tests, and completing assignments in advance were all significant advantages.

That was why Carl's information was invaluable. He had proven his skills since his first year.

With his natural charisma, he had built connections not only with fellow students and upperclassmen but also with assistant professors. More importantly, he had close ties with the staff working at Lumene.

By the start of his first year, he had already established an independent information network.

There was a reason the Noble Dormitory heads, Abad and Duran, had chosen Carl first during the dormitory selection process.

Especially Duran—who never acknowledged anyone without clear ability—recognized Carl's value despite his lack of combat prowess.

That was why, when it came to gathering intelligence, Carl was the most reliable option.

Now, as the entire group focused on him, Carl pulled a face. "Why are you looking at me like that?"

"You should take charge here, senior," Juen said, clearly pleased that her mentor was now the leader of this operation. Her eyes sparkled with anticipation.

Carl, unimpressed, responded flatly, "Take charge of what?"

"Huh?"

"If this were a labyrinth or a crisis caused by a Hero Dungeon, I'd do something," Carl said as he glanced around the casino. "But this is just an ordinary casino full of regular people. Sure, according to Leo, there's something underground, but..." He shook his head. "We need a hundred million points to get down there."

"So we just have to wait until an event happens?" Betty asked.

Carl smirked. "Not exactly. If we find out the details of the events in advance, we can make a plan. The frequent guests here should know what kinds of events are held. So we just have to get information from them."

"And how do we befriend them?"

"Wouldn't we get close by playing games together?" Chelsea asked.

Carl shrugged.

"Shouldn't we be careful not to waste our points?" Eliana tapped her VIP card. "With a goal of a hundred million points... the small amounts we have barely matter, don't they?"

Chloe nodded. "She's right. We shouldn't use them all, but participating in games is necessary for gathering information. We also need intel on the Azonia students."

According to Carl, the Azonia students who had entered Wargella had disappeared after coming here.

"If we find out where the Azonia students went, it'll help us explore the Hero Dungeon," he added.

The group nodded in agreement.

"Well, like Leo said, it wouldn't hurt to enjoy ourselves a little," Carl said. "Let's split up and gather information."

"The class prez already went deep into the casino alone, so we should get moving too. Let's go, Austin!" Eliana took the lead.

"Luke."

"Yes, Chloe-senpai?"

"You're coming with us."

"Understood."

Chloe entered the casino with her mentees, Betty and Luke.

"Shall we go too?" Chelsea asked.

Carl stuffed his hands into his pockets and followed after her.

"But isn't this casino illegal?" Juen muttered, pursing her lips. "Wouldn't the dealers cheat?"

"I doubt it." Carl shook his head. "Even if this place is illegal, a casino of this scale can't be built purely through shady dealings. It only works if there's trust."

Juen scoffed. "That's hilarious. Even a place like this needs *trust* to operate?"

She curled her lips into a smirk.

Meanwhile, Eliana stood with her arms crossed, staring at the spinning roulette wheel.

"How does this work?"

"You don't know?"

"Of course not. How would a refined lady like me be familiar with something like this?"

"I thought someone like you would've played plenty of these games, Eliana-senpai."

Eliana squinted at her companion. "And just *what* do you think of me?"

Without waiting for a response, she approached a nearby exchange counter and converted her points into chips.

"Well, let's give it a shot."

*Click— Click— Click—*

Carrying a stack of chips, Eliana stepped up to the roulette table.

"A cute little lady has joined us," a middle-aged noble muttered, puffing on his cigarette. "This isn't the place for a young girl like you."

Eliana flashed a bright smile. "Mister, could you teach me how to play?"

"There's nothing to it," he said. "You can bet on red or black, specific zones, or even a single number. Just place your chips where you want to bet."

Eliana let out an impressed hum. "Ohhh, I see."

She placed a single chip on the betting board next to the large roulette wheel.

"The class prez's eyes are red, so I'll bet here!"

A moment later, the spinning roulette ball landed in a red slot.

"Ohhh, I see how it works now."

The middle-aged man chuckled. "You've got decent luck, little lady. Though, this game isn't exactly hard to win."

He smirked as he watched her.

He had no doubt that her clear, innocent expression would soon transform into one of despair and obsession.

After all, that was the true nature of a casino.

*Watching a pure young girl fall into ruin is part of the fun here.*

It wasn't just the middle-aged man. Other guests around the table were watching Eliana with similarly eerie smiles.

But...

"I was in Class 5 with the class prez, so I'll bet between 1 and 18."

Victory.

"The class prez is sixteen years old, so I'll bet between 13 and 24!"

Victory.

"The class prez is..."

Victory.

Roulette was a simple game—just a matter of betting on red or black. The house always had the advantage.

Yet, as Eliana continued raising the stakes and lowering her odds, she kept winning.

"The class prez is..."

*Who the hell is this class prez?!*

The gamblers, who had been eagerly waiting for the moment her face twisted in frustration, swallowed dryly.

Even the spectators who had been anticipating her downfall began murmuring among themselves.

"What... what is with that girl?"

"And what's this 'class prez' she keeps mentioning?"

"No way. She's bound to lose everything and cry soon."

"The class prez is number one, so I'll bet on 1!"

Eliana finally reached for the highest payout in roulette—betting on a single number.

The onlookers sneered.

The odds were 1 in 36.

If she won, her payout would be thirty-six times her bet. But realistically, it was impossible.

Especially considering how many times she had won already.

Before anyone realized it, Eliana was the only one still playing at the roulette table.

Everyone held their breath, anticipating the moment her face would finally contort in frustration.

*Whirrrrr—*

The roulette wheel spun.

*Tick, tick, tick—*

"Player wins."

*Clatter—!*

Contrary to everyone's expectations, the ball landed in slot 1.

Eliana had just secured a massive victory.

"I'll hit a hundred million in no time!" she cheered, beaming.

The other gamblers, jaws agape, turned to her.

"G-Goddess of Fortune!"

"She's definitely a goddess of luck!"

"Goddess! Where should we bet next? Please bless us with your wisdom!"

Anyone who frequented a casino inevitably lost a fortune. Even nobles had financial limits.

Like most gambling addicts, the people here dreamed of striking it rich, clinging to meaningless superstitions to justify their bets.

And now, a girl with overwhelming luck had appeared.

Eliana watched as the gamblers swarmed around her, their voices filled with worship. After a brief moment of thought, she asked, "Have any Azonia students been here recently?"

A beastkin man raised his hand. "Yes! They were gathering information about the Hero Dungeon and Hero Hunters!"

"Oh?"

*Hero Hunters?*

Eliana narrowed her eyes.

The Hero Dungeon part made sense—Lumene was here for the same reason.

But Hero Hunters?

She recalled what Leo and Carl had told her about this casino functioning as an information guild.

*Could a Hero Hunter have appeared in this country?*

If so, they needed to be even more cautious.

"One more thing. The arena—what kind of fights have the highest prize money?"

"If you mean the arena... the highest payout right now is for the current champion!"

"Champion?"

"Yes! A rabbit!"

"......"

*A rabbit is the champion? What the hell does that mean?*

Eliana's face twisted in confusion.

"Goddess! Please tell us the next bet!" a desperate gambler pleaded.

She crossed her arms.

*I've run out of class prez-related bets.*

After a moment of thought, she smirked. "Number 1. I'm the number one magic swordsman of our year, after all."

"...But what about the young master?"

"You really think of him as a magic swordsman?" she said, shooting a look at Austin.

"Number 1!"

"Bet on 1!"

The gamblers eagerly followed her lead.

*Whirrrrr—!*

The roulette wheel spun.

*Tick— Tick— Clack—*

And the ball landed on 24.

"Aaaaaagh!"

"W-What the hell?!"

Cries of despair erupted around them.

"Hmm. I guess it doesn't work if it's not related to the class prez," Eliana mused.

"Honestly, if it's about Eliana-senpai, even the Goddess of Fortune would flee," Austin muttered.

"You wanna die?"

As the two bickered, casino staff quietly piled the massive stacks of chips Eliana had won onto a cart.

Once they finished, she grabbed the cart and made her way to the exchange counter.

"Austin, do you know the class prez's three sizes?"

"...No."

"Should we go ask? If we get the right numbers, I might actually hit a hundred million."

Carefree as ever, the two strolled away, leaving the devastated gamblers staring after them in disbelief.

"Hero Hunters?"

"Yeah."

Inside a private room reserved for King-tier guests, Leo sat behind a drawn curtain, his eyes narrowing. Across from him, Aru sat with her legs crossed and arms folded.

"Lewellin's Shadows mentioned Hero Hunters who can *transform.* I came here to gather more information about them."

Leo fell silent, deep in thought.

Cerna Lewellin. A powerful mage who served as one of Lewellin's Shadows. Chelsea and Abad's aunt.

She had eliminated countless traitors and Hero Hunters from the darkness.

During the previous winter break, despite the absence of a full moon, she had defeated a transforming Hero Hunter and summoned Azonia's student council president, Doberman Cales, along with Aaron's successor, Aru.

*Back then, that Hero Hunter had a fake Brave, didn't he?*

A sword resembling Aaron's beloved weapon—obtained from a Hero World.

It had allowed the user to transform.

*Could Tartaros be using Aaron's Hero Record?*

Leo's eyes gleamed with cold fury.

Sensing the sudden shift in his aura, Aru's tail bristled. She narrowed her eyes, bracing herself.

Just then...

*Knock, knock—*

A knock came from the entrance.

"I heard the student council president of Lumene was here, so I came to introduce myself."

Leo turned toward the doorway. He studied the man standing there, tilting his head slightly.

"And you are?"

"Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Darian Evren."

Darian offered a smooth smile. "I'm a Lumene graduate—your senior. I came because I have a proposal for you."

"What is it?"

"The labyrinth beneath this casino. Would you like to collaborate on its conquest?"
