At the highest point of Seiren, in the Plaza of Stars, a tense discussion unfolded among the elves. The entire academy stretched beneath them in a breathtaking view, yet no one was admiring the scenery.

"How do you intend to take responsibility for this?"

Revette, head of the second-year division, fixed the first-year advanced-class teachers with a piercing glare. At the forefront stood Jeras, the homeroom teacher of Advanced Class 1, his face drained of all color as he bowed his head.

"An entire advanced-class cohort losing to the lower class? What kind of education have you been providing to produce such a disgraceful outcome?!"

Jeras stammered, struggling to respond. "I-I only took over Advanced Class 1 midway through the term, so..."

"Are you making excuses?" Revette's voice rose sharply. "You were in charge of Advanced Class 2 before this, weren't you?"

Jeras flinched as her fury intensified, her sharp eyes locking onto him.

"This is already a difficult time, with so many fools failing to grasp our grand vision and daring to question our methods! And now you hand them a reason to doubt us with this *humiliation*?!"

"Ms Revette, let's remain calm," Orlen interjected, adjusting his glasses. "It's true that we must determine where responsibility lies. Our Pureblood Society's reputation has suffered a serious blow. However..." He turned his cold gaze toward the first-year teachers. "Before that, we need to investigate what happened with the lower class."

The air shifted as everyone's focus turned to Orlen.

"Isn't it strange?" he continued. "Students who lacked even a shred of talent for Stellar Magic suddenly displayed extraordinary abilities. There must have been foul play. And let's not forget—Leo Plov of Lumene was among them."

Revette stroked her chin thoughtfully. "That cunning wretch...If anyone could pull off some underhanded trick, it would be him. But we can't interrogate him so easily, Mr. Orlen. No matter how much we despise him, he *is* Lumene's student council president."

Her expression twisted in distaste, but Orlen merely smirked. "Leo Plov is untouchable, yes. But Miss Laura, the one responsible for overseeing the lower class? *She* can be questioned as much as we like."

"Then we'll prepare a hearing for Miss Laura," Revette said, her voice chillingly sharp.

Orlen's smirk deepened.

At that moment—

*Step. Step.*

The sound of approaching footsteps echoed across the Plaza of Stars.

The acting headmaster, Lehagen, emerged. The gathered teachers immediately rose from their seats.

"Lord Lehagen, we were just discussing the course of action regarding this matter. Our agenda includes..."

"I've already received the reports. Dismissed," Lehagen said flatly.

"...Excuse me?"

The teachers exchanged bewildered glances at his abrupt words.

"Did you not hear me?" His voice dropped to a cold whisper. The weight in his tone left no room for argument. 

Without another word, the teachers hurriedly exited the plaza, leaving Lehagen alone.

He exhaled deeply, then turned his gaze toward the empty air and spoke. "Care to explain what happened?"

A glimmer of crimson light flickered in the void. The ominous glow twisted and formed a rectangular frame before shifting into the image of a man.

[Whatever do you mean, my dear Lehagen?]

"Don't play dumb," Lehagen spat, his glare burning with fury. "Did you think I wouldn't see through your vile schemes?" 

He took a step forward, voice rising with barely restrained anger. "Was this your attempt to shroud Seiren in darkness once again?!"

[You misunderstand me,] the man—Hell Kaiser—chuckled. [I did indeed lend you my mana to help your precious Seiren's young prospects shine. But occasionally, power beyond my direct will can lose control. The Skeleton King's summoning was one such case, nothing more.]

"I don't believe you."

[Believe what you wish. But did you truly think a mere Skeleton King could endanger Seiren?]

Lehagen clenched his jaw. "...I suppose not."

Hell Kaiser's smirk faded. [Before we go any further, however, we must discuss *our* arrangement.]

Lehagen cleared his throat. "Khmm."

[I have already given you the lead to summon the Fairy King, have I not?] Hell Kaiser's gaze sharpened. [I revealed to you that the Comet Mage was secretly the Fairy King's contractor and that the key to fulfilling the elves' long-standing wish of forging a pact with the Fairy King lies in the Comet Mage's legacy—Cometes—and his bloodline.]

"And Lea Tingel *did* summon the Fairy King," Lehagen said.

[That was no true summoning, my dear Lehagen.]

"Hah! If she failed despite all my support, that's hardly *my* fault! What do you expect me to do if the summoner lacks the necessary qualifications?"

Hell Kaiser remained eerily composed. [I have all the time in the world, Lehagen. *You* are the one racing against it.]

Lehagen's fists clenched.

[The Fairy King once fought beside the Nebula Pioneer to defeat Erebos. If anyone knows the whereabouts of Erebos' scattered remnants, it would be him. Find those fragments and eradicate them. In return, I shall hand over the remains of the Comet Mage.]

Lehagen's expression darkened. "You *do* have the Comet Mage's remains, then?"

[Indeed. I was the one who retrieved the bodies of the Great Heroes who perished in the battle against Erebos. With my necromantic expertise, it may even be possible to bring the Comet Mage back to this world.]

"If I find so much as a scratch on the Comet Mage's remains, I *will* make you pay, Lich King."

[You needn't worry, dear Lehagen,] Hell Kaiser chuckled. [I look forward to hearing of your success.]

Just before the transmission ended, Lehagen sneered. "To think the so-called ruler of Tartaros plots to kill his former master just to take the throne...The loyalty of demons is as pathetic as ever."

[Ah, but I *am* a demon,] Hell Kaiser replied smoothly. [For you, inheriting the Nebula Pioneer and the Comet Mage's will to become the true leader of the elves may be a noble cause. But for a demon? Following a master long since vanquished is nothing more than the height of foolishness. Your mockery sounds like praise to my ears.]

With a final chuckle, Hell Kaiser vanished.

Lehagen scoffed as he watched him disappear. *When I become the next Great Hero, I will make sure to eradicate you myself.*

"Even in an era without gods, fanaticism still blinds people," said the Archduke of Mourning, Artkan.

Hell Kaiser leaned back against his throne of corpses. "That is not fanaticism," he said expressionlessly. "How can those who do not even know the gods understand true devotion? They are merely blinded by stubbornness and greed."

"Regardless, isn't this a fortunate turn of events for us?" Artkan remarked.

Hell Kaiser rested his chin on his hand, lost in thought.

"What troubles you, my lord?" Artkan asked cautiously.

"While some lead the world to ruin out of greed and stubbornness, others defy the will of our great god out of sheer ignorance," Hell Kaiser muttered irritably.

Artkan's expression stiffened.

"His eyes," Hell Kaiser muttered, scowling as Leo came to mind. "They look just like *theirs*."

Memories of those who had once slain the great god resurfaced, fueling his anger. Moreover, Leo Plov was of the same All-Class as the Hero of the Beginning. And at such a young age, he already possessed unsettling power.

"It would be best to cut the weed before it grows," Hell Kaiser said with a twisted smile.

Artkan bowed deeply. "I shall carry out your will."

The lower-class students exchanged uncertain glances.

Leo, watching them, spoke up. "Why are you all acting so stiff? It was the best exam ever—you should be celebrating."

A celebration party was currently being held in the lower-class classroom. Normally, the atmosphere would have been lively and boisterous, but everyone was hesitant, stealing glances at Leo.

"Uh... Um, Lyle, I mean, the student council president of Lumene. Thank you for leading us. So, uh..." Angel hesitated, unsure how to continue, shoulders shrinking slightly.

Leo clicked his tongue. "Why are you all so nervous? I'm just a student council president from another school."

"But...even if it's another school, you're still an upperclassman...and you're the *student council president*."

"Did we, um...offend you somehow?"

Leo let out a dry chuckle.

Just then—

*Creak—*

The door to the lower-class classroom swung open.

"Hey, everyone!" Eclair beamed as she stepped inside.

Her cheerful expression faltered as she noticed the way the lower-class students kept glancing at Leo.

"What are you all doing out here? Go inside."

Following behind her, Lea entered.

"Lea Tingel? What brings you here?"

"I heard there was a celebration. I came to congratulate you," Lea said with a small smile.

Angel grinned. "Thanks."

"I'm not the only one who came to celebrate."

"What?"

"Why's the mood so dreary? You're the stars of today's exam!"

"You should be enjoying yourselves!"

The Trina siblings appeared behind Lea.

"Seniors Alice and Garin?" The lower-class students blinked in surprise.

And they weren't the only ones. More well-known second-year students followed behind them, stepping into the lower-class classroom.

"Seniors Lunia and Eiran too?!"

The last to enter were Herdium and Laura.

"First-years," Herdium said, bowing his head. "As a teacher of Seiren, I owe you all an apology."

The students stiffened.

"I knew you were being discriminated against, but I did nothing. And yet, despite those hardships, you achieved something remarkable today. Your accomplishments will bring great change to Seiren. I am truly...truly proud of you."

Hearing the words of one of Seiren's most famous teachers, Angel panicked slightly. "N-no, it was all thanks to Miss Laura and...um, the student council president of Lumene."

Leo sighed. "If you're going to keep calling me that, just call me 'senior' instead."

Angel's face flushed slightly. "Th-then...I'll call you senior..."

Herdium turned to Leo. "Leo, we are deeply indebted to you. I don't know how we can ever repay you..."

Leo waved him off with a grin. "I didn't do anything. They're the ones who worked hard."

"Alright, alright! Let's save the formalities for later!"

"Yeah! Everyone, enjoy yourselves!"

Garin and Alice grinned as they spoke.

As former lower-class students themselves during their first year, they were well aware of the struggles these students had faced. Now, seeing their juniors achieve such an outstanding performance in the exam, they couldn't help but feel proud.

Thanks to their encouragement, the tense atmosphere finally eased.

The second-year Seiren students naturally gathered around Leo.

"It's a shame. Since you're here as an exchange student, it would've been nice if we got to study together," Garin lamented.

"By the way, you're human, right? How the hell do you use Stellar Magic so well? Got any secret techniques?" Alice asked.

"I just studied hard," Leo replied casually, sipping his drink.

Alice clicked her tongue. "There it is—classic honor student talk. 'I just studied hard.'"

"But you must've had an excellent teacher."

*Luna was not an excellent teacher.*

Leo recalled his days learning Stellar Magic.

*"Huh? Why can't you do this?"*

The memory made him chuckle dryly.

Lunia tilted her head. "How long are you staying at Seiren?"

"I'll be here until the academic conference."

Deep beneath the Comet Sanctum, the retrieved Hero Record of Seiren was stored in absolute secrecy.

*Whoosh—*

For a brief moment, black flames flickered, as if struggling to break free.

A moment later, however, the writhing flames were suddenly sucked back into the Hero Record, vanishing without a trace.
