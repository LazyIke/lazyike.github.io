With the return of the first- and second-years from their practical training, Lumene regained its usual liveliness.

Lumene was a school where students had to compete constantly and fight to survive. Every year, students from each grade were expelled. That was why first- and second-years made up the majority of the student body. With so many of them away on training, the school had felt noticeably emptier.

"Man, school really is the best. The outside world is dangerous. Nothing but suffering out there~ Studying like this is *so* much better," Carl sighed in satisfaction as the morning magic class ended, stretching lazily.

Hearing that, Chloe, who was organizing her textbooks, smiled. "Oh? Then how about we take this chance to review today's lesson?"

"Sorry, but I break out in hives whenever I hear the word 'review,'" Carl replied shamelessly.

Chloe narrowed her eyes. "The finals are coming up. What's your plan?"

Carl burst out laughing. "Tomorrow's problem belongs to tomorrow's me!"

Chelsea, who was leaving the lecture hall with Abad, widened her eyes. "You *have* a tomorrow?"

"Hey, that's a bit harsh."

"But it's true, isn't it? Your school life is as dark as Celia Zerdinger's hair."

At Chelsea's merciless jab, Carl let out a pitiful chuckle.

Meanwhile, Abad spoke up. "Personally, I'd like to see you survive, Carl."

Carl leaned back in his chair and sighed. "You think I don't want that too? So... wanna help me make some cheat sheets?"

"Carl." Chloe glared.

Carl simply shrugged. "Relax, it's a joke. Not like Abad would go along with it anyway."

Despite his gentle smile, Abad Lewellin, the most handsome second-year, was firm and cold-hearted. He was the opposite of Chelsea, who complained but always ended up taking care of others.

"So, what do you think the practical assignment for the finals will be?"

"The midterms were about familiars."

"But we haven't had any special lessons this time, right?"

As Chloe, Chelsea, and Abad discussed the upcoming exam, Carl mumbled to himself. "Sometimes, I feel like I don't belong here."

"Why?" Leo, who had been packing up his textbooks, asked.

"Just look at you guys. This is a gathering of the top-ranked students."

Leo smirked and got up.

"Wanna grab lunch?" Carl asked, hopping up from his seat.

"Yeah."

"I'll come too!"

However, Leo shook his head. "I've got plans today."

"Plans? Can I tag along?"

"It's a student council lunch."

Carl's face darkened. He'd been dragged to the student council before because of that whole love potion incident. The memories still haunted him.

Shuddering, he quickly said, "I'll pass."

Leo chuckled. "What about you guys?"

"We already have plans. We're having lunch with the students from Lordren," Abad said.

"I have a lunch date with Celia," Chloe added.

"Alright, see you later." 

With a nod, Leo left the lecture hall.

At the Student Council office in the Tower of Heroes...

"Oh, if it isn't the student council president?" A fifth-year student greeted Leo with a friendly smile as he walked in.

"Hello, senior."

"With Hark and Elena away, you're finally showing up to do some work, huh?"

The fifth-year knight student, Torlen, looked amused.

Hark and Elena, the two key members managing the student council, were currently leading dungeon-raiding parties in Aleham. Since they were among the strongest students in their grade, it was only natural that they'd been dispatched to deal with the large-scale Hero Dungeon outbreak.

As a result, with no one left to oversee the council, Leo had been summoned to fill the gap.

"You're the youngest student council president in Lumene's history, but before that, you're also the first *ghost* council member."

"I'm still just a second-year. I need to learn from my seniors before they graduate."

Leo smiled, but Torlen gave him a skeptical look. 

"Somehow, I get the feeling you'll be skipping out on council duties even when you're a fifth-year."

"Come on, don't be ridiculous." Leo shrugged innocently. 

Still, Torlen wasn't convinced. After all, even Hark—the official strongest student in Lumene—wasn't exempt from Leo's delegation skills.

Torlen had been in the same knight course as Hark for five years.

*I can say with certainty that Hark is living through the hardest school year of his life right now.*

Since first year, Hark had always been at the top of his class. As the heir to Rigard, one of Lumene's three great noble houses, even upperclassmen had been careful around him. Sure, he was always napping, but his grades remained at the top.

He had a bad relationship with Elena Zeron, Lumene's so-called queen, but even her faction couldn't openly oppose him.

And then last year, a student appeared who actually gave Hark a hard time.

That student was Leo.

Torlen shook his head.

*Once we graduate, Leo will dump all the student council work onto Elena Zeron.*

And when Elena graduated?

*He'll push it onto Lily.*

Lily Luce, a third-year and the student council representative of her grade. She was incredibly talented.

And when Lily graduated?

*He'll shove it onto his exceptional peers.*

Torlen sighed and shrugged. "Anyway, we've got some important matters today that need your approval."

"What is it?"

"I'll explain once everyone gets here." Torlen continued organizing papers.

Just then, Niel Rhoda, a fourth-year knight student entered the office.

"Ah, Young Master Leo. You arrived before I could escort you. My apologies," she greeted.

Neil was from House Rhoda, a vassal family of the Zerdingers, and was Celia's personal knight.

Originally, she had been part of the art club, but after Leo became the student council president, she joined to support him. It was both her personal choice and her family's. The Zerdingers wanted to solidify Leo's position after his record-breaking appointment as the youngest student council president.

Normally, getting into the student council was difficult, but since Niel was a top student, it hadn't been a problem.

"Hello, Senior Torlen," Niel greeted with a radiant smile.

A moment later, the office door opened again, and a fifth-year magic student walked in.

Niel's face immediately twisted in displeasure.

It was none other than Marcel Lugia—a member of House Lugia, vassals of the Lewellins.

Naturally, the two did not get along.

"It's been a while, Young Master Leo."

Unlike with Niel, Marcel greeted Leo with utmost politeness.

Even though Leo was from the Zerdingers, that wasn't why Marcel was being so formal.

Leo was Chelsea and Abad's friend. More than that, he was a young mage who had already accomplished extraordinary feats in the world of magic.

Age and seniority aside, Marcel had plenty of reason to treat Leo with respect.

"Chelsea mentioned that the students from the Lordren Empire were having lunch together. You didn't go with them?"

"I've been busy with student council work. As much as I'd love to join, I figured I should just have a quick meal and get back to work."

With most of the upper-year student council members dispatched to Aleham alongside Hark and Elena, nearly all of them were absent. That left only the three of them to discuss important matters.

"Alright, let's get started with the student council agenda. First up—club budgets for the summer term."

Torlen, acting as the secretary, cast a cold look at Marcel. "Marcel. The Magic Engineering Department is requesting another budget increase—again. They say it's to prepare for the Lumeiren Games next semester."

"Of course. Magic engineering is inherently expensive," Marcel replied calmly.

Niel narrowed her eyes. "This is excessive. Hark has always approved their budget increases using his vice president authority, but this is too much."

Despite the objections from the two knight students, Marcel didn't even blink. "Hark and I have already discussed it. Unless you'd rather call in Jaime Dect? He can explain exactly why the extra funds are necessary."

Torlen pressed his temples. *If we call him in, he'll start foaming at the mouth, ranting about things no one understands.*

Jaime Dect was a Magic Studies student but had been close friends with Hark since their first year. That was why Hark had been so willing to grant his requests.

Of course, the Magic Engineering Department had indeed achieved remarkable results this year, but there was no room to allocate any more funds.

Just then, Leo, who had been listening quietly, spoke up. "Should I go talk to him, or would you prefer to handle it yourself, Marcel?"

Marcel hesitated for a moment before nodding. "I'll explain it to Jaime myself."

"Then we'll proceed without approving the additional budget."

Torlen looked at Leo in surprise. "Jaime's going to lose his mind over this."

"He won't come running. If he doesn't accept it, I'll go to him. But I doubt he wants to see me."

Jaime Dect had a habit of running away whenever he saw Leo.

Last year, he had underestimated Leo, the first-year student council president, and tried to slip in extra budget requests—only to nearly have his funding cut instead.

For magic researchers, the scariest phrase in the world was *budget cut.*

And to Jaime, the student council president, who had the absolute power to logically justify slashing their funds, was more terrifying than the Grim Reaper.

With that, the club budget issue was resolved, and the student council meeting continued.

A short while later, Torlen brought up the final agenda item.

"Just before this meeting, we received an official proposal from the school board."

At his words, everyone looked puzzled. It was rare for the Lumene board to deliver an agenda directly.

"You all know that the world is still abuzz over the first- and second-years' practical training mission, right?"

Everyone nodded.

Though the students had completed their assignments and returned to school, the aftermath of the Aleham incident was far from over.

"The hero academies have been discussing the Aleham issue, as well as the recent Nebula Pioneer and Comet Mage's reappearance. There's a consensus that we need a forum for deeper discussion."

Torlen handed a document to Leo, who skimmed through it before narrowing his eyes.

"The World Summit?"

"Yeah." Torlen nodded. "The World Summit will be held here at Lumene at the same time as our final exams."
