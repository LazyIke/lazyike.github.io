Seiren's first-year lower class unanimously agreed to learn from *Introduction to Stellar Magic.*

Under normal circumstances, no student would dare take such a risk. The school treated the book as forbidden, and being caught with it could lead to expulsion—the worst possible outcome. But the lower-class students' desperation to improve outweighed any fear of consequences.

Even Leo hadn't expected them all to willingly take the risk.

*Then again, even when Seiren was functioning normally, students relied on underhanded methods to climb the ranks.*

He sighed, recalling last year's field trip.

Rauta Algra—originally a lower-class student—had rapidly improved and secured a place in Advanced Class 2. However, his sudden growth had come from wielding a demonic artifact given to him by the Lich King. In the end, he was hunted down by Lunia.

It was a case where ambition for heroism had twisted into obsession.

Leo had heard that Seiren conducted an internal investigation afterward, but he didn't know the details. What mattered was that students, driven by academic pressure, were straying down dangerous paths. And that wasn't a problem unique to Seiren.

It could happen at Lumene, Azonia, or Damien—any of the hero academies.

*Especially since Hell Kaiser is an expert at exploiting cracks like this.*

Leo clicked his tongue, thinking of the ancient commander who had endured for millennia.

Encouraging internal corruption had always been one of the Lich King's specialties.

*Wouldn't be surprising if the rise of racial supremacists in Seiren was his handiwork too.*

Narrowing his eyes at the thought, Leo refocused.

*Either way, things are off to a smooth start.*

Laura had been amazed after reading *Introduction to Stellar Magic,* which Leo had given her. She firmly believed Seiren should be actively teaching it instead of banning it.

*Luna would have been the happiest to see this.*

She had always wanted Stellar Magic to be passed down for generations.

*"Of course! If people keep learning my magic, it means I'll never be forgotten. Heh, that means they'll sing my praises forever."*

Leo let out a bitter chuckle, remembering how Luna had tirelessly worked to reinterpret her spell structures so others could learn them.

*Back then, I thought she was just full of herself… But now, I realize she never once doubted that we'd save the world.*

She had meticulously prepared for the legacy he would leave behind.

*Now, she's become a true legend—one that can never be forgotten.*

But time hadn't been on Luna's side. The task of making Stellar Magic more accessible had been left to future generations.

Two thousand years later, Seiren had accomplished it. Then, three thousand years after that, Len and Anna had followed suit.

*Professor Len and Assistant Professor Anna may have just been pursuing academic possibilities…*

But to Leo, it was the moment his friend's wish finally came true.

After applying their research in class, the lower-class students were astonished.

At first, they were skeptical, but it didn't take long for them to recognize the book's value.

*Well, anyone who gets into Seiren is bound to be talented.*

Their Stellar Magic proficiency might have been considered low by Seiren's standards, but that was just a matter of perspective.

Everyone had potential.

Especially for first-years, it was absurd to judge them based solely on their early academic results.

*The elven supremacists think Stellar Magic talent is innate… but that's a complete misunderstanding. It's not about talent—it's just a matter of mana affinity.*

They had placed Stellar Magic on too high a pedestal, leading to mistaken beliefs.

*As expected, some students stood out from the very first lesson.*

The most promising was Angel.

An aspiring magic knight, she excelled in spear techniques, aura skills, and general magic.

*Though since her main focus is spearmanship, her aura skills aren't as developed.*

Even so, Angel had shown remarkable progress in just a single day.

She herself seemed shocked at how quickly she improved.

*Once the lower-class students prove themselves in the midterms, someone will inevitably start investigating.*

That would naturally lead to the discovery of *Introduction to Stellar Magic,* the very book Seiren had forbidden.

*It'll shake the very foundations of the school. The supremacists might try to expel everyone involved…*

Leo remained indifferent.

*If that happens, I'll just have Mel transfer them all to Lumene.*

Normally, such a thing would be impossible.

But for Leo, it wasn't.

*Mel wouldn't complain if I told her to do it.*

If anything, she would move heaven and earth to make it happen.

Mel had once stolen an entire treasure vault containing Dweno's work from Damien.

*That lady's a thug in her own way.*

Leo let out a quiet chuckle.

At that moment—

*Tap! Tap! Tap!*

A knocking sound came from the window.

Leo raised an eyebrow and got up, pulling back the curtain.

When he saw the three figures crouched outside, he let out a dry laugh.

"Hey! Open up! It's freezing out here!" Lunia stood outside, arms crossed, visibly shivering.

"Leo, please...It's so cold..." Eiran's voice was pitiful.

Meanwhile, Lea's eyes sparkled with delight as she stared at Leo's outfit. "Pajamas!"

Leo unlocked the window. The three girls tumbled inside all at once.

"Ugh! So cold!" Lunia brushed the snow from her clothes.

Eiran was trembling, but Lea raised her hand and spoke clearly. "Senior Plov! I've completed the assignment you gave me!"

"Oh?" Leo tilted his head. "And your conclusion?"

"Seiren is a ruined garbage heap! I should seriously consider transferring to Lumene!"

"......"

Leo narrowed his eyes at Lunia and Eiran. "What exactly did you two teach her? Do you have no school spirit?"

"We were just being honest! She came up with that conclusion herself!" Lunia shot back before turning to Lea. "And hey! You're from the Tingel family! How can you badmouth Seiren like that when the Comet Mage Seiren built this school?!"

"Huugh?!"

Lunia's eyes flared as she locked Lea in a headlock.

Frantically, Lea slapped at her arm. "I-I surrender! Surrender!"

As the first-year and second-year representatives wrestled, Leo gestured toward the bed. "At least warm up first."

Lunia and Eiran froze.

"H-huh? Y-you mean on Leo's bed?"

"Yeah. Isn't it cold?"

"Senior Plov's bed!"

Without hesitation, Lea dove in.

Eiran hesitated, blushing, before slipping under the blanket and mumbling, "It smells like Leo..."

"I'm good," Lunia said.

"Why?" Leo asked.

"My father said never to lie in a strange man's bed."

Leo blinked. "You're the last person I expected to say that."

"What was that?"

"Also, weren't we cuddling in the same bed this time last year..."

"You wanna die?! That was *unavoidable!* And I told you I'd kill you if you brought that up in front of others!"

Lunia grabbed Leo's collar, her face bright red, and shouted.

Naturally, Leo remained unfazed.

Lea turned to Eiran. "Is Senior Lunia always this violent?"

"Yes," Eiran answered.

"You little...!"

*Thud!*

"I-I surrender! Surrender!"

"Lunia, it's getting hard to breathe."

Lunia tackled Lea and Eiran onto the bed, locking them both in a chokehold.

Lea thrashed, but Eiran, physically much stronger, remained unaffected.

"Huff...Huff..."

"Pant...Pant..."

After the scuffle, Lunia and Lea lay sprawled out, breathing heavily, while Eiran neatly wrapped herself in the blanket.

Leo sighed. *At least things won't be boring.*

"Lea."

"Yes, Senior Plov?"

Leo studied her curiously. "You don't seem particularly attached to this school."

Lea smiled. "It's not that I don't care about Seiren. I genuinely respect my ancestor. But since last year, I've wanted to enroll in Lumene."

"That's an unusual choice."

"Isn't it?" Lea chuckled.

Lunia and Eiran had both called Seiren a failing school, but despite their complaints, they still had deep affection for it.

"Whether I'm at Seiren or Lumene, I'll still be myself. I have confidence that I'll rise to the top anywhere. In that case, wouldn't it be better to study under someone I personally respect? Believe in yourself. Like my ancestor said, all I have to do is trust my own path."

Lea's conviction was unwavering.

Leo nodded, satisfied. "So then, what's the real reason you came sneaking into my room at this hour?"

Lunia crossed her arms. "You're planning something at Seiren, aren't you?"

Leo met her gaze evenly. "Yeah."

"What is it?"

"I'm going to push the lower-class students' midterm scores way up."

"What?"

"And prove that Seiren's current system is broken."

Lunia frowned, flicking her ears in thought. After a moment, she nodded. "If the lower-class students suddenly show massive improvement, the supremacists will lose ground. But how do you plan to pull that off?"

"Introduction to Stellar Magic."

"Ah." Lunia let out a small exclamation.

Eiran clapped her hands together. "Oh, that Stellar Magic primer written by Lumene's professor!"

Both had seen the paper when Leo taught them magic during the Smith Contract Workshop.

For students like Lunia and Eiran, who had already mastered Stellar Magic, it wouldn't have much effect. But for the lower-class students, the results would be undeniable.

"Got it. We'll help. You want us to teach them?" Lunia smiled, arms still crossed. Seiren wouldn't have any grounds to stop them from mentoring their juniors.

"No. If you help, it won't be as effective."

"What?"

"This has to be their achievement alone. The lower-class students need to prove their progress without outside assistance—only then will it have real value."

Leo's eyes locked onto Lunia's. "You might be a delinquent, but academically, you're still Seiren's top student."

"That's true, but...calling me a delinquent doesn't sit right. I'd be an honor student anywhere else, you know?"

Leo didn't hesitate. "You'd just be a top-ranking thug."

Lunia's eye twitched. She threw a punch, but Leo effortlessly dodged.

"Appreciate the thought, but this time, just watch."

Lunia let out a small sigh before grinning.

Eiran, her fists clenched, nodded eagerly. "I guess that means we should head back."

Lunia checked the time and moved toward the window, but Eiran and Lea hesitated, clearly wanting to stay.

With an exasperated sigh, Lunia grabbed them by the collars and started dragging them along.

"Lea. You stay."

"Yes!"

Lunia hesitated. "What for?"

Leo answered without much thought. "I have something to check."

"Alright." Without pushing further, Lunia climbed out the window.

Outside, Eiran flushed and pressed her hands to her cheeks. "A late-night meeting...alone in a dorm room...How romantic...!"

"Eiran, you really need help. Leo is basically an old man inside. He has zero interest in kids."

"But isn't that even more dangerous? Since he's an adult?"

"......" Lunia faltered, looking back at Leo's door.

After a moment, she muttered, "I take it back. He's not an old man. He's a grandpa."

{sep}

Lea sat in silence, eyeing Leo warily. *A boy and a girl, alone in a dorm at night.* She wasn't expecting anything, but not feeling at least a little tense would be strange.

Leo, meanwhile, pulled something from his pocket and sat down on the floor. "Why do you like Kyle?"

Lea's face brightened. "The Tingel family has a private journal written by Seiren."

"Seiren's journal?"

"Yes. Only direct descendants of the Tingel family can read it. It's forbidden from being shared with outsiders. Seiren himself left instructions never to disclose its contents."

"And you're telling me about it?"

"I don't think Senior Plov would spread it. Besides, no one would believe it anyway." Lea laughed.

Leo's expression hardened slightly. *Is it about Erebos?*

"What does it say?"

"A love story."

"......"

Leo's face twitched. "A *what*?"

"A love story!" Lea's eyes sparkled.

"The tragic and passionate romance between the Hero of the Beginning and the Nebula Pioneer! The journal is based on Seiren's firsthand experiences in the hero's world—so it has to be real!"

Leo felt his mind go blank.

*What the hell did that damned elf write?! I liked Luna?! It was Luna who liked me!*

Grinding his teeth, Leo forced a smile.

"By the way, why did you ask me to stay?" Lea fidgeted.

Leo smirked. "You failed to summon Fairy King Sylord and only heard his voice, right?"

"Yes."

Leo's smirk deepened. "Then let's try again."

He gestured to the floor, where he had drawn a summoning circle.
