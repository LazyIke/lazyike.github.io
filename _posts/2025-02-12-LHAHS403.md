"What? That Aru brat is training with the Lumene student council president?!" Tiger beastman Borman clenched his fists in frustration and shouted in disbelief. "She lets the rest of us have fun while she sneaks off for training? That sneaky little—!"

Ruwen, who was seated with her tail curled beneath her, calmly grooming her fur, glanced at him. "I wouldn't exactly call it training."

"What do you mean?"

"It looked more like she was being waterboarded."

Borman gasped, then immediately nodded with admiration. "So she's undergoing training so brutal it looks like torture? That Aru... incredible."

Ruwen sighed and shook her head. There was no getting through to this guy.

Meanwhile, a group of Azonia girls had gathered, watching the Lumene students. 

Ruwen approached them. "What are you all looking at?"

"Ruwen, Ruwen, look over there."

A wolf beastman girl pointed toward Abad and Duran, who were lounging under a parasol. 

Abad, with his usual relaxed expression, was reading a magic tome, while Duran also had a book in hand.

Ruwen frowned. "What, are you thinking of fighting them? If so, forget it."

Azonia students naturally had a strong competitive spirit, especially toward powerful opponents. 

Given that Abad and Duran were among Lumene's strongest in both the knight and magic departments, Ruwen assumed her peers were eager to challenge them.

But the girls shook their heads.

"Not at all."

"We just want to hang out with them."

"They've got a different kind of charm compared to our muscleheads."

Ruwen glanced at Abad and Duran. Indeed, they were a rare type among Azonia students. 

Moments later, a few of the girls approached the two, striking up a conversation.

Elsewhere, Lumene and Azonia students mingled freely. Some Lumene first-years were even eagerly asking the Azonia students questions.

*As expected, Lumene students have a strong thirst for knowledge.*

Ruwen nodded approvingly—then her gaze drifted to another group, and her expression turned dry.

*Unlike these idiots.*

"Are they training for underwater combat with those toys?"

"Hmm... doesn't seem effective."

A few Azonia students watched the Lumene students playing with Carl's water guns, mistaking it for training. 

Ruwen shook her head.

*Boom!*

Suddenly, a massive column of water shot up into the air. Every student turned to look.

"Why are you attacking us all of a sudden?!"

"Yeah! And that's totally unfair!"

Celia and Chelsea, who had been locked in a fierce chase moments ago, were now fleeing together. 

Behind them, wielding Carl's custom water cannon with terrifying momentum, was Eliza.

"Shut up. I'm drowning both of you today." Eliza growled, mercilessly blasting them with water.

"Aaahhh!"

"Run!"

"Blub-blub-blub!"

Unfortunate bystanders caught in the crossfire were left soaked and gasping.

Seeing this, Borman clenched his fists. "Of course! As expected of Lumene's elites, even their fun is like real combat training!"

Eyes shining, he shouted, "I'm joining in!"

Completely misinterpreting the situation, he charged after them.

Ruwen clicked her tongue. *This is a disaster.*

"They're handling their mentoring roles better than I expected," Professor Mel remarked as she reviewed the reports submitted by the second-years.

Professor Harrid, the professor overseeing the first-year program, replied, "If they couldn't, they wouldn't have been chosen as mentors." 

His tone was indifferent, as if it were no big deal, but there was clear trust in his voice.

Mel smiled, recognizing it. "Professor Harrid, when this year's second-years were first-years, which student caught your attention the most?"

Harrid's answer was unexpected. 

"Carl Thomas. Both in a good way and a bad way."

Mel blinked. "That's surprising."

"Why, were you expecting Leo?"

"Yes, honestly."

"In most cases, that would make sense." Harrid glanced at the documents before continuing, "But personally, I'm not even sure if Leo Plov should be categorized as a student. No matter how talented someone is, no one should be able to grow the way he has."

His eyes sharpened. "After a year of watching him, I started wondering—is he really *growing*? Or is he just *recovering* his lost strength?"

*Sharp.* Mel smirked internally.

"But Carl is still unexpected. Even within his class, there's Chelsea. Why choose one of the weakest students in the so-called 'Golden Generation'?"

"I told you, he interests me both in a good and bad way." Harrid sighed. "In a bad way, Carl is limited. He'll never stand on the same stage as heroes, and he knows it. He's never once believed he could become a hero. In that sense, he's already disqualified as a hero candidate."

"That's true."

"But even so, he survived. Others, stronger than him, were expelled, yet he remained. And in his second year, he even cleared the Divine Blacksmith's world." 

Harrid narrowed his eyes.

"He's a different kind of student from the typical Lumene elite. Almost no one enters Lumene with the goal of being a supporter."

"He's incredibly self-aware."

"Exactly. He does have talent, otherwise, he wouldn't have even made it in, but compared to the Lumene standard, he's mediocre at best. And yet, many students rely on him in some way. Even now."

Not only had Carl supported the first-years, but he had also led the battle against an unknown draconic spellcaster. The same was true during the midterms.

"On the battlefield, he reinforces those around him, helping them push beyond their limits. That's a special kind of talent."

"Are you saying he's a leader?"

"No, he'll never be a leader. But..." Harrid smirked. "He's the kind of person who supports leaders."

Mel recalled something Leo had once said.

> "No matter how great a hero is, they can't do everything alone. You know that, right? Even heroes struggle. Carl is the kind of guy who'll be there when heroes are at their lowest."

As Mel nodded, she asked, "Then among this year's first-years, who has caught your eye the most?"

"There are two. Both in a good way and a bad way."

"One of them must be Aina Beidna, right?"

Harrid nodded.

While overshadowed by the legendary second-years, this year's first-years were impressive in their own right—so much so that they were being called another golden generation. 

Aina led the pack, alongside Haviden in the knight department, Juen in magic, and Sasha in summoning. 

They were a solid class, rivaling the recently graduated Rhys, Torua, Ulta, and Jamua's year.

But Aina was on another level.

*She's on a completely different tier from her peers, but...*

Harrid's gaze darkened. There was one big problem.

"Aina doesn't want to be a hero. She wants revenge."

Mel sighed. 

*Kalian Beidna.*

She knew all about the Sword Saint. 

If she was going to challenge the Dawn Records again, Kalian would have been her first choice to recruit. He was a hero who had shaped an entire era.

But his personal life had been tragic.

Aina, his great-granddaughter, had lost every single one of her blood relatives to Tartaros. 

Well, she wasn't the first to seek revenge. Many before her had walked the same path.

The problem was her talent.

With the skill to be called the second coming of the Sword Saint, Aina had all the power necessary to take on Tartaros. And so, she had honed her blade for vengeance.

"It seems Aina's obsession with Leo is also tied to her desire for revenge," Mel added.

No one yet knew the secret—that in order to inherit the full legacy of the Sword Saint, she needed Leo's recognition.

Harrid replied, "If she's driven by nothing but vengeance, she'll eventually hit a wall at this school."

"That's true. And the other student you're interested in?"

"Luke Eldar."

Mel chuckled. "Luke, huh? He's a diligent model student. Kind, eager to learn... though his grades don't quite keep up."

"Exactly. But that's part of the issue."

Harrid smirked. "Luke Eldar has always pushed Aina Beidna forward."

*Ever since Leo accepted Luke as his mentee... No, maybe even since the entrance exam.*

"She tries to ignore it, but after this latest incident, Luke's existence will motivate her even more."

That evening, a party was held at the Lumene students' lodging—a celebration to unwind before returning to school, marking the successful completion of their practical training. 

The Azonia students had been invited as well, mingling freely.

A little away from the main gathering, Leo stood with his arms crossed, watching the students laugh and chat.

"What are you doing all alone out here?" Mel approached him.

"Just reminiscing a little." Leo smirked.

"I've never seen you get nostalgic before, Leo."

"It's hard not to. I just met Lysinas again."

Mel, who had been too busy with faculty duties to hear the details, blinked in surprise. "Lysinas?"

"And Rodia too."

"What the hell happened?"

Leo briefly explained everything that had transpired.

"Going into a Hero World... only to end up inside *another* Hero World?" Mel looked dazed.

Leo chuckled, then turned his gaze back to the party. "Back then, after something big happened, we'd always hold a feast to shake off the weight of it all and move forward."

"Whose idea was that?"

"Lysinas'."

Mel nodded, then looked at him with curiosity. "What was the day you met Lysinas like?"

Leo's smirk turned a little wistful. "That day? We ended up having a feast of our own. It was the beginning, after all."

After Tartaros' great assault, in an elf-run tavern owned by Tilla, Kyle and Lysinas sat at a table.

On the second floor, Lysinas had been writing in a journal. She closed the book, took a deep breath, and stood in front of the mirror, straightening herself out.

*This is just the beginning.*

Her first companion was an insufferable bastard, but his joining marked the start of everything.

Leaving the room, Lysinas descended to the first floor. The tavern was empty. She approached a table with two rough-looking beer mugs already set down and took a seat across from Kyle.

"Sorry, sorry. Had something to take care of."

Kyle merely gave her a flat look.

"Today marks the founding of our subjugation party. It's a historic moment! Drink all you want. I'd buy drinks for the whole tavern, but... with you here, no one else dares to step inside."

"The Surviving Hero is a symbol of misfortune, and the Fool spreads useless hope. Of course, people avoid us."

"That's how it is *now.* But soon, their perception will change. This city will change too." With firm conviction, Lysinas lifted her mug. "Now, before we get to serious matters—let's toast. To our future, and to the hope of the world."

Kyle sighed and reluctantly clinked his mug against hers. As he drank, Lysinas studied his face.

Kyle frowned. The journey ahead was utterly absurd, and thinking about it left him with nothing but exhaustion and frustration.

But above all, what unsettled him the most... was the dragon sitting across from him, watching him *way* too intently.

"What?"

"What, what?"

"Why are you staring at me like that?"

Kyle scowled, but Lysinas just took another sip of her drink and shook her head.

"No reason."

Kyle expected her to drop it. But she didn't stop looking at him.

"Seriously, what is it?" Unable to take it anymore, he pressed her again.

"Just..." 

Lysinas propped her chin up with one hand and smiled faintly.

"…Because I want to."
