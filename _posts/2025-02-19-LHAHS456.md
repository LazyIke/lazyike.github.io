The world was shaken by the abnormal incident in the Dellad Kingdom.

The communication magic and teleportation magic systems in the western continent had completely shut down in an instant. At the same time, ominous dark clouds covered the sky.

It was a phenomenon eerily similar to the Return of Disaster that had occurred 3,000 years ago, plunging the world into fear.

Recognizing the severity of the situation, Dragonia issued a hero summons. As a result, hero guilds and hero associations around the world began to take action. With the movements of Tartaros also raising concern, the world was gripped by tension.

Heroes who had assessed the situation remained on high alert.

Thus, as dawn passed, shrouded in despair and terror, by the time morning arrived, the abnormal phenomenon had completely vanished. Many heroes, who had been bracing for the worst, felt both relief and confusion.

Then, astonishing news spread.

\<The terror of 3,000 years ago! The Primordial Evil! Has revived!\>

Reports about Erebos spread worldwide through newspapers. And just as the world trembled in fear, another piece of news was delivered.

\<After 5,000 years, the Brave Hero has awakened! Another legend has returned, following the Nebula Pioneer and the Comet Mage!\>

The revelation that the Brave Hero Aaron had appeared and vanquished the resurrected Erebos sent the world into a frenzy. This led to a wave of pilgrimage to the site of the great battle.

Following the incident, the training retreat was concluded ahead of schedule. Some returned home to enjoy their vacations, while others remained in the Plov estate.

Two days after the retreat ended, late at night, Carl, along with Lunia, Aru, Eiran, and Drianna, gathered in a guest room, chatting.

"That's why people should always be prepared," Carl grinned as he pulled something out of a box and placed it on the table one by one.

Lunia narrowed her eyes. "And what's that supposed to be?"

"What else? Statues."

What Carl had laid out were none other than small, palm-sized statues of Aaron, intricately crafted in various heroic poses.

"I'm not asking because I don't know. I'm asking why you made so many of them."

"Why else? To sell them."

"Are you insane? You're planning to use the Great Hero as a money-making scheme? Do you want to get arrested for blasphemy?"

Lunia looked utterly dumbfounded. In elven society, exploiting the Nebula Pioneer for personal profit was considered a grave crime. Because it involved using a Great Hero of their race, it was deemed highly immoral and strictly punished.

"It's illegal among elves, right? But beastmen don't have such laws," Carl smirked.

"Ah! So there are no such laws in beastman society." Eiran nodded in understanding.

Lunia scoffed with her arms crossed. "Hmph! Even if there aren't any laws against it, do you think beastmen would just stand by while you try to profit off Aaron?"

"Tsk, tsk, tsk. Didn't I tell you? People should always be prepared."

With a triumphant look, Carl pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket and handed it to Lunia.

Reading it, Lunia's expression soured. It was a contract—written proof that Carl had received Aaron's permission to manufacture and sell statues of himself.

"When did you even get this approved?"

"The moment I heard Aaron had crossed over from the Hero World, I had a feeling! A pilgrimage, tourism—this was going to be huge! And with Aaron's endorsement, I can sell these at a premium price to rich tourists! Especially to beastmen! Wahahaha!"

"Why do you love money so much? As far as I know, even as a student, you already have considerable wealth. And with your skills, you'll have no trouble making more after graduation."

"I'm curious too. You're blatantly materialistic, sure, but I also know you're a decent guy. You're not the type to be obsessed with unnecessary riches."

At Drianna's words, Lunia also nodded, staring at Carl. Eiran looked equally curious, prompting Carl to scratch his head awkwardly.

"You guys know I'm not hero material or anything, right?"

"That's true."

"Yeah, that's right."

"Ah, no! Carl, I think you absolutely could be!"

Drianna and Lunia answered without hesitation, while Eiran fumbled to comfort him.

"Thanks, Eiran. You're so much nicer than this ill-tempered elf and this... whatever Drianna is."

At Carl's words, Lunia's eyes gleamed ominously.

Ignoring her, Carl shrugged and continued. "I want to be a supporter, but I don't want to help you guys just in battle. Whether it's weapons, materials, or potions—I want to secure everything you need. And for that, I'll need a lot of money."

"How much are you planning to make?"

"Enough to buy an entire country?"

At Carl's cryptic response, Lunia and Eiran's eyes widened.

"That's... surprisingly profound."

"That's incredible, Carl!"

Lunia and Eiran were impressed.

"Carl! You truly are my dear friend!" Drianna, on the other hand, threw her arms around Carl with joy.

Looking down at her, Carl said firmly, "I have zero intention of funding your art."

Drianna's face twisted. "Why are you so stingy? A man claiming he'll buy a whole country has such a small heart! If you support me, your name will go down in history alongside mine as I become a great artist like Dweno!"

Watching Drianna revert to her usual way of speaking, Carl replied, "If I fund your artistic endeavors, Dweno will grab me by the collar and personally make sure I regret it. And honestly, I'd rather bury my money in the ground than fund your art."

"How is burying money in the ground a better use?"

"At least then, the world won't have to see your horrendous creations."

"You know, he has a point." Lunia agreed with Carl.

Drianna raised a fist, and Eiran panicked, trying to stop her.

"Anyway, what's with that cat over there?"

Inside the Plov estate, at one corner of the room, Aru sat silently, staring at the broken Brave.

"Aaron's departure must have really upset her," Eiran spoke with concern.

Lunia and Drianna exchanged glances before nodding and approaching Aru.

"How long are you going to sulk?"

"Yeah. Don't just think about Aaron all the time."

At their words, Aru stood up. Then, without a word, she walked into the room.

"Hey, Aru. Don't be so..."

"Don't touch me." Aru spoke coldly, dodging Lunia's attempt to place a hand on her shoulder.

Lunia hesitated, then furrowed her brows. "Isn't that a bit too harsh?"

"How dare you try to touch me!"

Aru swiftly evaded Lunia's hand, her expression smug.

Lunia was left speechless.

"I, Aru Tune, was personally recognized as Aaron's successor! You guys are on a different level than me!"

Carl, lounging on the sofa, spoke indifferently. "Did you really think she'd be depressed?"

Drianna frowned. "So? What do you mean by 'different level'?"

"Lunia, did Luna ever personally call you her successor? No, right? Drianna, same for you. But me? I'm the only one. The only one recognized as a successor by a Great Hero!"

With a smug smile, Aru nodded to herself. "Ah, successor. What a beautiful word."

Muttering as if savoring the sound, Aru's eyes suddenly gleamed.

"With my status, do you really think I should be sitting at the same table as you? This is my era now!"

Lunia and Drianna exchanged glances.

Drianna then snuck up behind Aru and held her in place.

"Ready, Lunia?"

"Of course. Hold tight."

"Go for the solar plexus."

"NYAAAH?!"

His room in the estate.

It was far larger than his room in the capital mansion—so large it was almost excessive. A characteristic of border noble families. With vast lands at their disposal, their rooms were unnecessarily spacious.

Seated by the window, Leo gazed at the full moon and downed the liquor in his glass.

In his past life as Kyle, he had often enjoyed drinking, but after being reborn, he rarely touched alcohol. It wasn't because of his age or school regulations.

*There was simply no need to drink.*

All of the Great Heroes drank frequently. Not just the Great Heroes—every hero of that era drank often. It was a way to momentarily forget the hardships.

*Well, in Luna's and Dweno's cases, they simply loved getting drunk.*

Resting his chin on his hand, Leo smirked and spoke. "Stop hesitating and come in."

He had already noticed the presence outside his door. And, of course, he knew exactly who it was.

At his words, the small presence flinched, then carefully opened the door and peeked inside. With a bright smile, she asked, "Leo, what are you doing?"

"Just thinking."

The visitor was none other than Chelsea.

At Leo's response, Chelsea stepped inside, closed the door, and approached him. Her eyes widened when she saw the bottle of liquor in front of him. "You're drinking?"

Leo answered with a silent smile.

Watching him, Chelsea hesitated. Leo gestured toward the seat in front of him. She sat down and quietly observed him.

Even under her gaze, Leo remained silent, staring out the window. The soft moonlight pouring in made his white hair glisten.

After watching him for a moment, Chelsea took a deep breath, as if gathering her resolve. "Leo."

"Yeah?" Leo replied as he poured himself another drink.

Chelsea hesitated, then finally spoke. "Aaron told me... that you're the Hero of the Beginning, Kyle."
