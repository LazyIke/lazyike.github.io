"Wow, this is insane. Completely insane." Carl, wearing a hospital gown in Damien's ward, clicked his tongue as he read the newspaper.

"Of course it is. The Giant King, who hasn't shown himself in thousands of years, suddenly appeared. Yum—" Lunia spoke while munching on a rabbit-shaped apple slice cut neatly on the table.

"You've got quite the dexterity, surprisingly," Drianna commented as she stabbed an apple slice with a fork, making Aru glare at her.

"What do you mean, 'surprisingly'? Huh?"

"But it really is pretty," Eiran admired the rabbit-shaped apple as if it were too precious to eat.

*Clack—*

Just then, the door opened, and Leo walked in.

"Did the treatment go well?" Carl asked.

"The healer says I need to rest for a few more days," Leo answered indifferently, picking up an apple slice.

Aru muttered darkly, "A tragic case of kin slaying."

"What are you even talking about?" Leo gave Aru a puzzled look before plopping down next to Carl.

Carl folded the newspaper and murmured, "Anyway... it was incredible."

"Yeah."

They had always known the Great Hero was remarkable. Except for Drianna, the rest had actually witnessed the Great Hero's feats firsthand.

But it was the first time they had spent such a long time together, learning from and listening to him.

"I doubt any other raiders who cleared the Great Heroes' world got to learn from them like we did," Aru nodded with his arms crossed.

"Speaking of which, Leo, you missed seeing Kyle again, huh?"

"Kyle? What are you talking about?"

"We saw Kyle right before we finished clearing the Hero World."

*Pfft! Cough! Gah! Cough!*

Leo choked violently on his apple at Drianna's words. Startled, Eiran patted his back.

Once he finally recovered, Leo asked, "You saw Kyle?"

"Yeah, and he was incredible. He took care of Erebos's flames like it was nothing. Man... seeing him up close, all I could do was be amazed."

Carl recalled the moment, murmuring, "Even using a pegasus as a spirit beast was shocking."

Hearing that, Lunia added, "And his swordsmanship—flawless."

"Not a single wasted movement," Aru crossed his arms.

"And that final spell he used to land the last blow—it was beautiful," Drianna nodded firmly.

Carl clicked his tongue. "If a true perfect All-Class exists, it would be someone like that."

Eiran beamed brightly. "Yes! He was just like Leo!"

*Of course. Because that was me.*

"Leo's still got a long way to go to catch up to Kyle."

"Black Rabbit may be great, but Kyle is a Great Hero."

"If you had met him, he could've been a great role model for you."

At Lunia, Aru, and Drianna's words, Leo let out a laugh inwardly.

*That was me, you idiots.*

"Anyway, does this mean we're stuck in the hospital until the Exclusive Smith Contract Workshop period is over?" Carl leaned back on the couch, hands clasped behind his head.

"Yeah. We need thorough checkups and also have to write reports on what happened in the Hero Record," Lunia let out a small sigh.

"Ugh, just thinking about seeing those annoying professors already pisses me off."

"So you've fully committed to the delinquent student route, huh?"

"Hmm? Got a problem with that?"

"Of course not, big sis."

Lunia smirked, and Carl quickly shook his head. If he teased her any further, he might get hit.

"Speaking of the Exclusive Smith Contract Workshop..." Drianna's expression turned serious. "This experience made me reflect a lot. I said I admired Dweno, yet... what did I actually do? Nothing. It really made me think."

"Did you also reflect on calling that weird scrap metal 'art'?"

"Shut it, dumb cat." Drianna shot Aru a glare before clearing her throat.

"Meeting Dweno taught me so much, made me realize a lot." She looked down at her small hands. "I finally understand what I can do with these hands—and what I must do."

Clenching her fist tightly, Drianna declared, "If you all are willing, I'd like to become your exclusive smith."

"I'd be honored to have someone as skilled as you as our exclusive smith, Drianna!"

"You're a pervert, but your skills are solid."

"And more importantly, you've been acknowledged by Dweno himself."

Eiran, Aru, and Lunia all nodded. Seeing their reactions, Drianna smiled.

"Thank you. Now, let's formalize it with a contract."

She pulled out a contract and a pen from her pocket, handing them out to the group.

"Here, just sign at the last section."

Lunia, Aru, and Eiran, without any suspicion, were about to sign when Carl shouted in alarm.

"Hey, hey, hey! What are you guys doing?!"

"Huh? Signing a contract for an exclusive smith...?"

"You didn't even read it properly! What if there's some weird clause in there?"

"What? Drianna would never trick us!"

"You rich kids are way too trusting," Carl shook his head.

Meanwhile, Lunia and Aru narrowed their eyes and started flipping through the pages. Then, upon seeing a certain clause near the end, they glared at Drianna.

"What the hell is this?"

"It's a clause regarding my artistic pursuits and the contract's modeling requirements."

"And why does it specifically say 'nude modeling'?"

"Because being in one's purest, most natural form is the epitome of beauty! Especially you, Lunia! Since Dweno himself chose you as a nude model, I have an obligation to share your divine form with the world through art—"

"What kind of insane nonsense are you spouting?!"

Lunia, face beet red, violently ripped the contract to shreds. Aru followed suit, tearing his apart as well. Eiran's face was completely flushed.

"You should be thanking me."

Carl also tore his contract in half.

Watching the scene unfold, Leo let out a deep sigh.

*Have these guys actually grown at all?*

Leo and Carl left the infirmary on the final day of the exclusive smith contract period.

On their way back to the dormitory, Carl let out a deep sigh. "We ended up missing our entire academic schedule. It's a miracle that we can even attend the banquet on the last day. I thought I'd have to stay in Damien for a few more days," he said, making a disgusted expression.

"There was just that much to talk about from this Hero World conquest," Leo replied.

It had truly been an unprecedented event.

During the Age of Calamity, the battle of Godthrone was one of the largest conflicts. The fact that they had experienced it firsthand was incredible. Not only did they meet Dweno, the central figure of that Hero Record, but also Great Heroes like Aaron and Kyle. Even one of the most revered figures in elven history, Velkia, had appeared in that Hero World.

A Hero Record where so many of the greatest figures from various races appeared had never existed before. Academically, the experiences of Leo and his party held immense value.

Hearing their conversation, Sedgen spoke up. "You two went through a lot. Especially you, Carl. You had the hardest time."

"Well, Professor Sedgen, you helped me a lot."

Of all the things that had garnered attention from this expedition, Carl was at the center. It was inevitable.

Carl's conquest reward was the alchemical manuscript written by Dweno himself—essentially, Dweno's knowledge in its entirety. Unlike the others, who received items crafted by Dweno, or Leo, who declared that he had no conquest reward to avoid unnecessary commotion, Carl's reward was something that could be shared. Because of that, individuals from all races were eager to get their hands on it.

In the midst of it all, Sedgen stepped in.

> "The rewards obtained from Hero World rightfully belong to the conqueror. The decision of what to do with them is entirely up to the individual. And yet, those who should know this better than anyone are now pressuring a young student to share his conquest reward? Even before Carl has had a chance to examine the manuscript himself? This is hardly elegant behavior. You should be ashamed of yourselves!"

Sedgen's genuine outrage was met with a response from Seiren's investigator.

> "Knowledge only gains true value when shared. Besides, isn't that student on the verge of being expelled from Lumene due to his poor academic performance? It seems to me that this reward is far too valuable for him."
>
> "Carl has demonstrated skills in alchemy that surpass any other second-year student at Lumene. Not only that, but during this Hero World conquest, he was personally recognized and taught by Dweno himself. The rewards granted by Hero Record are always appropriate for the contributions made in the conquest. That statement of yours can easily be seen as belittling both Dweno's judgment and the will of Hero Record itself."

Sedgen's cold rebuttal shut down all further pressure against Carl.

"To be honest, I was really moved," Carl admitted.

"I only did what any professor should. That conquest reward belongs to you alone. If you choose not to share that knowledge, Lumene will stand by your side and protect your decision."

"Professor Sedgen!"

"Carl!"

Watching this heartwarming display of camaraderie between teacher and student—when not too long ago, this same professor had grumbled about losing money to Carl's schemes—Leo shook his head.

"At least it was a good thing that Harrid and Rina weren't there."

"What would've happened if they were?"

"Harrid would've chewed them out for talking nonsense, and Rina would've thrown a punch."

Sedgen sighed and shook his head. "Once you reach a certain age, you should behave like an adult. How is it that they still act so immaturely?"

*Of the three, the most immature one is probably Professor Sedgen...* Carl muttered internally but didn't voice his thoughts. He didn't want to ruin the moment.

Following Sedgen's lead, the two finally arrived at their dormitory.

As the door opened, the students gathered at the entrance for the banquet turned to look at them.

"It's Leo and Carl!"

"Huh?"

"Leo! Carl!"

"Leader! Carl!"

Led by Chelsea, the students who had been in the same class as them in their first year swarmed toward them. Others who were close to them also gathered around.

"I heard you were seriously injured. Are you fully recovered?"

"Leo, how's your body holding up?"

Chloe and Chen Xia asked worriedly, and Leo smirked. "I'm mostly healed."

"Leo! You're amazing! You actually conquered Dweno's world! I don't think any student has ever conquered multiple Hero Worlds like you!" Chelsea bounced excitedly as if it were her own achievement.

"What was it like? How were Dweno and Aaron?" Celia's eyes sparkled with anticipation.

Everyone was eager to hear about the Great Heroes.

Aaron, who was said to have possessed unparalleled martial prowess. Dweno, the great blacksmith who had also been the shield protecting his comrades.

For the knight students, hearing their exploits was enough to stir the heart.

Meanwhile, Carl, who had reached the dormitory, was greeted by Abad with a grin. "Welcome back, Carl."

"Abad, you're the only one who ever greets me properly. I thought the others would give me a more enthusiastic welcome," Carl spoke in a mock-hurt tone.

"Hmph. Did you think we'd treat you any differently just because you conquered Dweno's world?" Eliza scoffed as she casually filed her nails from her ornate chair.

Duran, with his usual haughty tone, added, "You're full of yourself, Carl Thomas. Don't you agree?"

"Um... I guess...?"

"I mean, I was actually really looking forward to hearing about it..."

"Shh, shh! If you say that, those two will target you."

The noble students whispered among themselves. Abad chuckled at the sight.

"So? How were Dweno and Aaron?"

"How should I put this?" Carl crossed his arms and smirked, glancing at the students in the dormitory. "You want to hear? Gather around. I'll tell you what I saw."

Eiran and Duran flinched.

"N-Not interested."

"I already know plenty about them from historical records."

Eliza and Duran lifted their chins stubbornly.

But the other students clearly had different thoughts. They stole glances at the two nobles, hesitating.

"If you want to listen, don't mind us. We're just... not curious."

"Hmph. Of course, the stories of Great Heroes would be fascinating. Not that I'm interested."

Despite their words, the noble students eagerly gathered around Carl.

"Then!"

"Hey! Carl! Tell us already!"

"Hmm~ Where should I start? Maybe with the time Aaron blocked the Giant King's attack with a single swing?"

Duran flinched. Eliza smirked at his reaction.

"My, my. Acting like you don't care, but you're dying to hear it, aren't you?"

"As if I'd care about a commoner's story..."

"Or should I talk about the Phoenix Queen, who was Lysinas's contract spirit? Have any of you ever seen a white phoenix?"

"Is it true that Flame Emperor's feathers are pure white?!—Ah!"

Eliza clamped her hand over her mouth, realizing she had just responded reflexively.

Abad grinned. "Stop putting up pointless pride and just listen."

"Yeah~ Duran! As a knight, how could you not want to hear about Aaron and Dweno?"

"Eliza! Hurry up!"

The noble students urged them forward. With a sulky expression, Eliza finally took a seat in front of Carl, while Duran reluctantly stood beside Abad.

Watching the lively group of Lumene second-years, Sedgen smiled. *Our students will gain much from this experience.*

"Let's save the details for the banquet. Leo, Carl, go get ready. As Lumene students, you must show elegance to the students of other academies, even on the final day."

At Sedgen's words, the students let Leo and Carl go, albeit reluctantly.

The final event in Damien was coming to a close.
