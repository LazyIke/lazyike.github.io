After the announcement of the mission training, the first and second-year students busied themselves with preparations. The magic department students gathered in the second-year lecture hall to discuss the upcoming mission.

"I thought this would be some kind of secret mission, but we're openly entering Aleham without even hiding the fact that we're Lumene students," Carl muttered, sitting cross-legged on his chair. 

He rested his clasped hands behind his head, lips jutting out in a pout. A pen balanced precariously on his upper lip.

"I was expecting something more like an undercover intelligence-gathering operation," he grumbled.

Juen nodded in agreement. "Yeah, that would have been way more interesting."

Hearing their conversation, Chloe clicked her tongue. "There's no way you can hide an entire group of first and second-year students entering Aleham at once."

She was right. Even if they attempted to conceal their identities, there was no way to hide the arrival of hundreds of students warping into Aleham all at once. It would be even more noticeable considering that they were all teenagers.

"Besides," Abad added, casually crossing his legs and smiling, "it also applies pressure on Aleham. Declaring that we're Lumene students works to our advantage."

A few first-year girls let out small squeals at his words. As one of the most popular second-years, every move Abad made seemed to captivate the younger students.

A first-year male student hesitantly raised his hand. "Why would we want to pressure Aleham by revealing our identities? Wouldn't making our investigation official just make them hide their secrets even better?"

"If Aleham really is covering up the existence of a Hero Dungeon, they won't exactly welcome outsiders digging into their secrets," Abad replied.

The first-years nodded.

"And if they really want to keep those secrets hidden," he continued, his smile never fading, "don't you think they'd go as far as killing to protect them?"

His tone was casual, almost playful, but the words were chilling. The first-years flinched.

"A-As if they would actually do something like that! I mean, we're Lumene students!" the same first-year stammered, half in disbelief.

Abad tilted his head. "That's the point. If we were sneaking in, we wouldn't officially be Lumene students, would we?"

Resting his chin on his hand, he continued, "Hiding a Hero Dungeon is a serious offense. Depending on the Hero Record involved, it could put the entire world at risk. Lately, the danger of Hero Record rampages has become more evident. Think back to last year and this year. You all know what happened in Seiren when a past-era legion commander crossed over through a Hero World, right?"

The first-years swallowed nervously. Everyone knew about that disaster. And that wasn't even mentioning the invasion of the Queen of Monsters.

"If the Hero of the Beginning Kyle and the Nebula Pioneer Luna hadn't miraculously appeared... we wouldn't be here right now," Abad said flatly.

A heavy silence fell over the room.

"The destruction of a nation is a real possibility when a Hero Dungeon goes berserk," he continued. "And yet, *someone* is risking that danger just to keep this one hidden."

His voice was calm, matter-of-fact.

"If they're willing to take that kind of risk, do you really think they'll hesitate just because we're Lumene students?"

Cold sweat dripped down the backs of the first-years.

"On the other hand," Abad went on, "if we *do* wear the title of Lumene students, they can't touch us so easily. The moment they do, Lumene—and the nations we belong to—will intervene directly."

His sharp gaze swept over the younger students. "That's why the professors decided that, for now, most of you still need the protection of Lumene's name. Don't forget that."

The first-years, who had been buzzing with excitement about their first mission, fell silent. Many of them had seen this mission as a chance to prove themselves, a moment to represent Lumene with pride.

But now they realized that if they let their excitement get the best of them, they could make a fatal mistake. Abad had just given them a reality check.

Watching from the side, Carl let out a small whistle of admiration. "When he's like this, Abad is seriously impressive."

Chelsea folded her arms smugly. "Of course. He is the next heir of the Lewellin family, after all. But speaking of which, where's Leo? Wasn't he supposed to be with the magic department today?"

Each department was handling its own mission training preparations.

Carl shrugged. "He said he had to visit Professor Tina for a bit."

*Whoosh! Whoosh!*

[My wings!]

Kiran was darting around Professor Tina's office in an erratic figure-eight, clearly ecstatic.

Watching from the side, Fiora, who had polymorphed, muttered dryly, "He really does look like a moth."

"Agh! *A moth?!* Fiora! Please insult me more!"

"Elsie told me to stay away from Arty. She said I'd pick up bad habits."

At Fiora's flat dismissal, Arty clutched her chest with one hand, using the other to dramatically veil her face. "Oh, the cruelty! How could you say such heartless things with such an adorable face?"

Fiora, still young and unbothered by such antics, simply tilted her head.

*Arty is completely insane.*

She shifted her gaze toward Kiran, who was flapping his new set of wings so violently that shimmering dust scattered everywhere.

*And that fairy is basically a moth.*

Fiora crossed her arms and gave a firm nod.

*Yep. I'm the only one who's actually useful to Leo.*

With a haughty, elegant gait, she stepped forward.

Kiran, still zipping around in excitement, zoomed over her head. His frantic wingbeats sent a shower of glittering dust onto Fiora's nose.

"Achoo!" She sneezed. "Ugh! What do you think you're doing?!"

[Aren't my wings amazing?]

"They make you look exactly like a moth."

Kiran flapped even harder in response.

Annoyed by the dust cloud, Fiora narrowed her eyes, grabbed a thin book, and raised it like a flyswatter. "You little pest! Hold still!"

*Crash!*

Tina's lab descended into chaos.

*Shhhk!*

A sharp slicing sound cut through the air as a scalpel flew in, landing precisely between Fiora and Kiran.

Tina, still seated, glanced lazily at the two frozen spirit beasts. "If you two don't quiet down, I'll dissect you," she said in her usual languid tone, but her eyes gleamed with unsettling intent.

Arty immediately stepped in front of Fiora and Kiran, sighing in disappointment. "To be frightened by that? Have you no shame? You're the Three Great Summons! Where's your pride?"

Fiora and Kiran glared at her.

"We'd rather not hear that from you."

[Yeah.]

Meanwhile, Tina turned her attention back to Cometes.

"It really is fascinating," she mused, examining the artifact with interest. "A relic that only responds to the Tingel bloodline... yet here it is, reacting to you."

Leo had come to collect Kiran's wings as part of his deal with Seiren, but since he was here, he had also shown Tina Cometes.

Originally a treasure of Seiren Academy, it now belonged fully to Leo.

"You're definitely a research-worthy subject, Leo," Tina murmured, sipping her coffee. She smiled playfully. "Want to play doctor with me?"

Her lips curled slightly in amusement. "Don't worry. I won't eat you."

"I'll have to decline," Leo said dryly. "Just research Cometes instead."

"Pity," Tina sighed, though she didn't seem particularly disappointed. Handing him a small note, she added, "Since you're heading to Aleham, visit this place in Wargella."

"Wargella? Isn't it the largest oasis city in Aleham?"

"That's right."

Leo glanced at the note. "The Pleasure Palace."

"It's a brothel run by someone who controls a major part of Aleham's underworld." Tina smirked. "Show them this, and it'll be a huge help for your mission."

"Thanks," Leo said, tucking the note away.

The following week, after preparations for the mission training were complete, the first and second-year students gathered in front of the warp gate.

"Where are you planning to go?"

"I'm going to focus my investigation on the capital."

"I'm heading to the area around the Monster Forest. Since it's a gathering place for mercenaries, it should be a good spot for information."

Most students had already decided on their areas of investigation and were actively discussing their plans. 

Of course, they weren't limited to a single location. Since the entire country of Aleham was their target, they would need to use the warp gates frequently. 

Collaboration between teams was also possible, making information exchange and tracking each other's movements essential.

This mission was not a competition but a cooperative effort. The first-years listened closely to their mentors, their faces tense with anticipation. Some were already imagining that next year, they might be the ones guiding younger students through a similar mission.

As the students continued their discussions, a loud, familiar voice rang out.

"Comrades! Are you all prepared?"

Sedgen made his entrance, dramatically spreading his arms as he stepped before the warp gate.

"This is no ordinary mission training! You are representing *Lumene* in this investigation of Aleham! The results of your efforts may shift international relations, and neighboring countries may find reassurance in your findings! Do not forget the weight of this responsibility as you carry out your mission!"

"Yes, sir!" The students responded in unison.

Sedgen nodded before continuing. "Also, understand that Aleham may be a *stimulating* place for some of you! Be careful not to lose yourselves in excessive indulgence or let your vision be clouded!"

Carl raised his hand. "Professor Sedgen! What kind of punishment do we face if we... engage in activities that aren't exactly appropriate for students? Or if we use certain facilities?"

Before Sedgen could answer, a voice from below the platform cut in.

"There is no punishment."

The entire student body froze.

Coming from Harrid, the strictest enforcer of school regulations, this response was completely unexpected.

Seeing their disbelief, Harrid continued. "Before you are students, you are hero candidates. You must be responsible for your own actions." 

A cold smile tugged at his lips.

"Experiencing different things isn't necessarily bad. But if you become too engrossed and end up ruining your own life, that is not the school's concern."

A collective gulp echoed among the students.

Harrid swept his gaze over them before continuing. "This mission training will last two weeks."

"Excuse me?"

"Two *whole* weeks?"

The unexpected duration caught everyone off guard.

"Yes. Since this is a long-term mission, I will now distribute the necessary funds. As this is part of your education, you are forbidden from using personal wealth or family resources. Additionally, there will be no further financial support for the duration of the mission."

With that, he handed out pouches of money.

Carl opened his and immediately gawked. "Holy shit! What happens to any leftover money after the mission?"

His voice carried disbelief at the substantial amount inside.

"Any remaining funds are yours to manage," Harrid replied flatly. "That is all."

Even noble-born students were surprised at the generous sum.

With all preparations complete, Sedgen raised his voice once more. "Then! I wish you all success! Comrades!"

And with that, the first joint mission training of the first and second-years officially began.
