Divine power, also known as divinity, was the power used by the gods. As such, it was not a power that earthly beings like humans, elves, beastmen, or dragons could wield.

*The power that vanished when the gods disappeared from the world.*

Of course, divine power had not completely disappeared. The Hero Record itself was composed of divine power. It was, quite literally, the last remnant of the gods left in the lower realm.

*If divine power manifested in this world after the Age of Calamity... then it must have originated from the gods of the past.*

An example of that was Pivua, whom Leo had met within the Hero Record. Although he was merely a fragment of the past, Pivua had been a god close to omnipotence, and he had bestowed his blessing upon Leo, lending him his power.

*But I already used up all the divine power I received back then.*

Through the divine power granted by Pivua, Leo had been able to perform two miracles.

The first was manifesting the power of his past life. For a brief moment, he transcended time and space, gaining the power of the Hero of the Beginning, Kyle.

*The second was...*

Leo clenched his fist tightly. Summoning Luna, a being of the past, into the present timeline, even if only for a short while.

The case with Seiren was different. Seiren had spent 3000 years endlessly repeating the battle against Erebos in the Hero World of Dawn, but she was still very much alive. Bringing a living person out of the Hero World was within Leo's authority as the master of the Hero Record.

However, Luna, a figure from the past who had already died, was different.

*It was an act that exceeded the limits of the miracles the Hero Record could produce.*

By temporarily bringing Luna out of the Hero World, Pivua's divine power had been completely exhausted. Even Polyum, the vessel that had contained Pivua's divine power, had been handed over to Seiren.

*So... where did this divine power come from?*

Hearing Leo's mumble, Melina carefully asked, "Divine power... you mean the power of the gods?"

"That's right."

"My goodness. Then does that mean that you could summon your power from the past...? Or even bring another Great Hero into the present era?"

"It would be nice if that were possible."

Leo narrowed his eyes as he focused his mind in response to Melina's excited question. He tried to exert his will to release the divine power, but there was no response.

He sighed, "It seems impossible to control it at the moment. It's such a faint power that I didn't even notice it until you pointed it out."

Melina looked regretful, but asked, "How did you acquire divine power, anyway? Hmm… The Shadows refer to you as the God of Shadows. Could it be related to that?"

"No, I don't think so," Leo shook his head. "I'm not well-versed in theology, but as someone who lived in the era when gods existed, there's one thing I know for certain."

"What is it?"

"Humans cannot become gods. That applies to all other earthly races as well."

Before the Age of Calamity, the world had been called the Age of the Gods, and extensive research had been conducted on deities. Gods were fundamentally transcendent beings, completely different from the inhabitants of the earth.

"Whether us mortals worship them or not, the gods do not care. No matter how much people revere me as if I were a god, that alone wouldn't grant me divinity."

"I see," Melina nodded in understanding.

Leo's red eyes gleamed.

*Whatever the case, the fact remains that divine power has accumulated within me. If I can figure out the reason and learn to use it… Divine power will undoubtedly be a great asset in the battles to come.*

The Xian Empire's attendance and the appearance of the Silent Dragon. Unexpected events unfolded, and incidents that had been merely speculated upon became reality. 

Interest in the summit grew even more intense, and the eyes of the entire world focused on Lumeria City.

However, even as global attention converged, there were always those too busy with their own matters to care. Among them, perhaps the busiest of all, were none other than the first- and second-year students of Lumene, standing right at the heart of this summit.

All regular classes had already ended. For the second-years, even their exams were completely finished. Now, whether or not they would remain at Lumene next semester—everything depended on the first-year tournament evaluations.

"Professor Len, who do you think will win this year's first-year tournament?"

Despite his frequent episodes of manic outbursts, Len was still one of the most competent professors at Lumene, and he had already completed grading for all second-year students.

Because of that, both he and his assistant professor, Anna, were spending a leisurely moment in the classroom where they had taught throughout the semester, waiting for the term to officially end.

The reason they remained in the classroom was simple. Lumene students were highly devoted to their studies, so even now, with vacation just around the corner, there were always those who came by to ask questions. They chose to wait in the classroom rather than in their offices because it was far more convenient for students to visit.

*From that perspective, it's clear he really is a passionate professor,* Anna mused.

Len gracefully lifted his teacup. "The most likely victor is Aina Beidna."

Taking a sip of his tea, he nodded in satisfaction while keeping his gaze fixed on the book he was reading. 

Given that Len was an incredibly handsome man, this moment alone made him seem like an exceptionally intellectual magic professor.

Anna subtly smiled. *If only he weren't reading that ridiculous book...*

Len was currently absorbed in a book titled "Why Mages Are Superior to Knights and Summoners". Just seeing it gave Anna a headache.

At that moment, the classroom door opened, and both Len and Anna turned toward the entrance. 

Seeing the unexpected visitors, Len's eyes narrowed. "Seiren?"

Anna swallowed dryly. Seiren Academy was one of the biggest sources of Len's outbursts this semester. Given that, it was no surprise that she felt nervous when Seiren students suddenly appeared in their classroom.

*I just hope he doesn't go into a frenzy again...*

While wearing a worried expression, Anna soon realized that the Seiren students were familiar.

*Her name was... Angel Bizan, right?*

They were lower-class students at Seiren who had been unfairly treated due to their lack of accomplishment in Stellar Magic. Of course, that was no longer the case.

Thanks to Seiren's policy changes and the book "Introduction to Stellar Magic" that Len had written, their lives had changed, and they had risen out of their lower-class status.

"You're Angel, right?"

"Ah! Assistant Professor Anna!"

Angel and the other former lower-class students excitedly rushed toward Anna.

"It's good to see you all! How have you been?"

"Great!"

"It's all thanks to Assistant Professor Anna and Senior Leo!"

The first-years beamed as they chattered excitedly.

SLAM!

"Senior Leo? He's not even from your school, and yet you call him 'Senior Leo'? Do you even realize what you're saying?" Len said sharply, closing his book with a loud snap and shooting up from his seat. 

His eyes burned so fiercely that it seemed like they might actually shoot lasers.

Faced with Len's terrifying aura, the Seiren first-years trembled in fear.

"Why are you here?!"

Summoning all her courage, Angel cautiously asked on behalf of the group. "W-Who are you?"

"My name is Len Hors! I'm the professor most revered by the Leo Plov you so carelessly refer to as 'Senior'!"

"...Stop lying," Anna muttered, staring at him with a skeptical expression, but Len ignored her completely.

At the mention of Len's name, Angel and the other first-years widened their eyes in shock. 

Then, stepping forward, Angel greeted politely, "So you're Professor Len! It's an honor to meet you! My name is Angel Bizan!"

Though they had been cowering in fear just moments ago, their eyes now sparkled with admiration. This took the edge off Len's earlier hostility.

"Professor Len, your book 'Introduction to Stellar Magic' changed my life. Thank you so much!"

"We truly respect you, Professor!"

"It's an absolute honor to meet you!"

Genuinely overflowing with gratitude and admiration, the Seiren first-years practically radiated reverence toward him.

Len let out an impressed "Hooh!" and nodded. "So you're the Angel Bizan I've heard about. I received your letters. As expected, you are indeed an outstanding student!"

Only moments ago, he had been brimming with hostility, yet now he had completely shifted his attitude. 

Watching this, Anna let out a deep sigh.

From then on, Len engaged in an enthusiastic discussion about magic with the Seiren first-years.

"Right now, your reputation at Seiren is extremely positive, Professor Len."

"Even among the elves, many are amazed by how deeply you understand Stellar Magic despite not being one of us."

"There are many who say your work has given them a whole new perspective on Stellar Magic!"

"According to rumors, there's even talk of inviting you as a visiting professor during summer break."

"Hohoho! To think that Seiren, a school renowned for its magic, would praise me so highly—I don't know what to say!"

Anna sighed. *That's not what you said before, though.*

> "If they have even a modicum of intelligence and their brains aren't just decorative accessories, recognizing the greatness of my research is only natural, Assistant Professor Anna!"

Later, two other top Seiren first-years, Eclair and Yoinia, also arrived to meet Len. 

Angel turned to them and asked, "Where's Lea?"

"She was with us just a moment ago, but then she suddenly disappeared," Eclair replied.

"Aww, I really wanted to introduce her to Professor Len." Angel looked disappointed.

Meanwhile, Anna approached Len and whispered, "...Just an hour ago, you were cursing Seiren Academy, and now you've completely changed your attitude."

Anna gave him a half-lidded stare, but Len simply smirked. "Assistant Professor Anna, one must know how to conceal their true feelings according to time and place. A person who maintains a difference between their words and inner thoughts is what we call a man of character."

"Who in the world calls that 'a man of character'?" Anna pointed out, but Len didn't even blink.

*Swish-! Swish-!*

The hallway of the Lumene first-year classroom building. As students passed by, their gazes turned toward someone moving stealthily.

*...A Seiren student.*

*Why is she sneaking around like that?*

*Does she really think that makes her less noticeable?*

A Seiren first-year had brazenly infiltrated the hallways, packed with Lumene first-years, while still wearing the Seiren uniform.

Lea Tingel was currently tailing someone with great effort. As her target turned the corner, she quickly approached the hallway's edge and peeked around. 

She fixed her gaze on her target's back.

*Luke Eldar.*

She pulled out a photo of Luke from her pocket. The source was none other than Carl. While moving with the Seiren students, she had spotted Luke and followed him all the way here.

*The mentee of Senior Plov. To monopolize such an enviable privilege all by himself—I won't forgive it.*

Burning with competitive spirit against someone who had done absolutely nothing wrong, she clenched her fists.

"...Who are you? Why is a Seiren first-year here?"

A voice called out from behind her. Turning around, she found Haviden standing there.

Lea straightened her posture, faced Haviden, and raised her chin confidently. "My name is Lea Tingel."

"Lea Tingel?"

"Wait a minute! Isn't she the top first-year of Seiren?"

Surprised voices erupted from all around.

"The representative of Seiren's first-years came all the way here?"

Arms crossed, Haviden looked at her inquisitively. 

Lea, mirroring his stance, responded, "I'm here to defeat my arch-nemesis."

"What? What? A declaration of war?"

"Is this for the Lumeiren Games?"

"Whoa!"

"Who's the arch-nemesis? Aina, of course?"

The first-years buzzed with excitement.

"So you came alone to invade, huh? You've got guts." Haviden smirked.

As the commotion grew, more students flooded into the hallway. The increased noise drew even more attention, and soon, Aina appeared. 

The gathered students instinctively parted, forming a clear space between Lea and Aina. The representatives of Lumene and Seiren's first-years were now face-to-face.

Aina looked completely baffled by the situation. While everyone tensed up, expecting something to happen...

Lea raised her hand. Then, she pointed at someone and said, "Luke Eldar."

Everyone's gaze turned toward Luke. Having approached out of curiosity, Luke now looked just as confused as Aina.

"Fight me."

"Huh?" Luke, failing to grasp the situation, asked again.

The other students were just as bewildered.

"I said, fight me right now."

"Why me?" Luke looked utterly wronged.

Lea glared at him. "Because you're my prey."

"Hey, Seiren first-year representative," Haviden chuckled. "Luke Eldar is my prey. I won't allow you to lay a hand on him first."

"If you get in my way, I'll take you down first."

"That's my line."

*Crackle-*

Haviden and Lea locked eyes, radiating tension. Just as the atmosphere turned menacing and the students held their breath...

"Professor Harrid is coming!"

At the urgent warning, the first-years flinched and immediately scattered into their classrooms. 

Their coordinated retreat left Lea utterly baffled.

"Hey! Luke Eldar! Stop right there! Fight me right now!"

Lea's clueless outburst echoed through the entire hallway, but just as she was about to dash after Luke, a spine-chillingly cold voice rang out.

"Who said you could fight in the hallway?"

Lea froze on the spot.

"Who said you could shout in the hallway?"

With stiff, mechanical movements, Lea turned around. Standing there was Lumene's Wailing Wall, Harrid.

"Hiik?" Lea instinctively took a step back, overwhelmed by Harrid's ominous presence.

"Seems you're not afraid of punishment."

Lea paled, but even in her fear, she mustered the courage to protest, "I-I'm not a Lumene student!"

Her instincts screamed that she should not let this man take her away, but Harrid was unmoved.

"I don't care what school you're from." Harrid grabbed the back of her collar. "If you're at Lumene, you follow Lumene's rules."
