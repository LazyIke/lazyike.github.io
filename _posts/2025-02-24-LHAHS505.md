The streets were filled with flowers. Petals fluttered everywhere, enhancing the festival atmosphere.

Leo walked along, lost in thought.

*Worrying about Velkia, huh.*

If Luna herself considered Velkia to be the regret she left behind, then that was likely true.

In a way, it was very much like Luna.

*Aaron, Luna, and I... we all knew just how much potential Velkia had.*

It didn't take deep thought to realize she would grow into an exceptional magic swordsman.

*That's why Aaron and I didn't worry too much about Velkia when we left on our final journey. However, Luna was different.*

Leo recalled how Luna had kept glancing back at Velkia until the very end.

*She must have been worried.*

It wasn't just a simple concern about strength.

*Just because someone is strong doesn't mean their spirit won't break.*

Unlike Luna, Leo had believed that Velkia would make it through on her own.

*If anything, I was more worried about Bihar than Velkia.*

Not because he liked Bihar more than Velkia, but purely because of Bihar's past.

*Either way, right now, I have no idea how to help Luna let go of her regret.*

Thinking that, Leo glanced at Eiran, who was walking ahead.

*Maybe we should visit El-Salbekia after the festival ends?*

He recalled visiting the Ersar family estate back in his first year. Surely, Velkia's traces would remain there. If Luna could see those remnants, perhaps she would find some peace of mind.

*...I don't know.*

Leo clenched his fist. He pretended to be indifferent, but in truth, his emotions were complicated.

When Aaron had disappeared after defeating Erebos, he had wanted him to stay in this era. He had hoped Aaron would enjoy the peaceful world he had helped create.

However, Aaron had chosen to return to his rightful place.

It was the same now. Leo wanted Luna to stay in this era as long as possible.

It was a simple wish, one made for a comrade who had endured the Age of Calamity alongside him.

"What's got you thinking so hard?" Carl asked.

"Luna," Leo replied.

"Ah." Carl let out a small exclamation. "You said she's a lingering spirit right now, right?"

"Yeah."

"Then is there any reason to worry? It's not an immediate problem, right? You can think about the serious stuff later. I think you and Lady Luna should enjoy life a little more." 

Although Carl understood that it wouldn't be good for Luna to stay as a lingering spirit for too long, he deliberately kept his tone casual. 

"You're a good guy, Carl."

Carl playfully feigned embarrassment. "Whoa! Getting praised by a Great Hero who saved the world makes me feel kinda shy."

Leo chuckled.

"Oh, right! Let's stop by Courage Street for a bit! I want to check if the item I put up for auction got sold."

At Carl's words, Leo, Eiran, and Chen Xia nodded.

As Courage Street buzzed with activity, Carl headed off to collect his auction earnings. In the meantime, Leo, Eiran, and Chen Xia wandered around to explore.

"Come, hear the heart-pounding heroic tales of the great heroes!"

Storytellers and bards were enthusiastically calling out to passersby.

Leo had seen this countless times, so he was about to walk past with a small smile when a familiar voice said, "Today, I will share a hidden story from history. The tale of the Hero of the Beginning, Kyle."

The performance must have gained a reputation for being interesting, as a crowd had gathered.

"There was a woman who loved the Hero of the Beginning, Kyle. She was none other than the light of hope in the dark Age of Calamity, the Wise Queen Lysinas."

The storyteller spoke with a sorrowful tone.

"However, Kyle, the Hero of the Beginning, actually loved someone else. A beautiful, pure, compassionate, noble elf—a single, delicate flower among the heroes. The Nebula Pioneer, Luna."

With such a lovely voice delivering such a dramatic revelation, the audience was completely captivated.

"Sir Leo, I believe Lady Luna is quite drunk," Chen Xia whispered cautiously.

Sure enough, several empty bottles lay scattered around Luna, who was telling the story.

"My goodness. Sir Leo, you loved Lady Luna?" Eiran covered her mouth, looking flustered.

Leo narrowed his eyes at Luna.

Regardless of his reaction, Luna continued speaking, fully absorbed in her storytelling. Her narration was compelling, as if she had personally witnessed those times.

Which, of course, she had.

Everything she said was true… except for the part about Kyle and Luna's relationship.

"The final moment arrived. 'Luna, you can't die! You promised me that after this battle, you'd love me! You left the mark of love on this very cheek!', 'I'm sorry, Kyle. I don't think I can keep that promise...'"

*...She remembers when she confessed to me?*

Luna had claimed she didn't remember anything from outside her Hero World, but the moment she mentioned kissing his cheek, Leo knew.

With a cold smile, Leo pushed through the crowd toward Luna.

"Kyle smiled sorrowfully! Even Lysinas, who had resented Luna, grieved her death... Hiiik?"

Just as the story reached its climax, Luna let out a shriek.

Her eyes had met Leo's.

Leo said, "Drag her over."

Without hesitation, Chen Xia moved toward Luna.

However, Eiran hesitated. To an elf, forcefully taking the Nebula Pioneer Luna away was an unthinkable act of disrespect.

"It's fine. I permit it," Leo added.

After hearing Leo's words, she made up her mind and approached Luna.

With both her arms grabbed, Luna was dragged away by Chen Xia and Eiran as if being arrested.

"W-Wait! You guys! After everything I've done for you, how could you do this to me?! Especially you, Eiran! You…!"

"I-I'm sorry."

"Ugh! I knew being nice was useless! Let go! Let me go, you dogs of Leo!" Luna shouted.

"What... is going on?" Carl, who had just finished collecting his earnings and had met up with Lunia on the way back, was left standing in stunned confusion as they watched Chen Xia and Eiran haul Luna away.

After reuniting with Luna, the group continued to enjoy the festival.

During that time, Luna didn't say a single word to Leo. Now sober, she was so mortified by her drunken antics that she couldn't even look at him. 

Leo, for his part, didn't go out of his way to tease her. He simply watched her with an unreadable smirk.

*Should I just punch him?* Luna clenched her fist tightly, veins bulging in frustration.

All throughout Lumeria City, many Lumene students had set up festival stalls. Among them was a small café.

"Huh? Looks like the third-year seniors are running this one."

"Oh, you're right."

Carl and Chen Xia widened their eyes in recognition.

Since it was a café run by hero candidates, it was naturally packed with customers. For Lumene students, the Twilight Festival was practically a school event, so it made sense.

"Oh!" a cheerful voice called out. "Hyung-nim!"

Every head in the café turned toward the source of the voice, and for good reason. A graceful female student had just called a male student 'Hyung-nim'.

Carl and Chen Xia stared, stunned.

"Senior Lily, aren't you embarrassed?" Leo asked.

Lily's face turned red, but not because she was embarrassed about the title. "Hyung-nim, please speak comfortably to me, even in front of others."

It was because Leo, whom she had decided to serve as her mentor, still addressed her formally.

Leo sighed inwardly, *At this rate, it'd be less awkward if she just called me "Master" instead.*

Lily took their orders and returned to the counter.

"When did she start calling you Hyung-nim?"

"Somehow, it just happened." Leo replied indifferently, resting his chin on his hand.

The sun was beginning to set. The café had been set up in Lumeria City's central plaza, giving them a clear view of the stage where the festival's celebratory performances were taking place. On stage, a famous orchestra and bards were performing.

"The atmosphere's nice." Luna rested her chin on her hand and mumbled.

At that moment, Lumene's music club stepped onto the stage. Standing in the center was a familiar girl.

"Chelsea!" Carl let out an exclamation of admiration.

The music club had prepared not only a musical performance but also a celebratory concert. Before long, the instruments began playing, and Chelsea started to sing.

"♬~"

With her eyes closed, she sang with a beautiful voice, honoring the Heroes of Dawn and the Great Heroes, a song filled with gratitude for those who had fought to save this world.

Everyone was left dazed by Chelsea's singing. 

When the song finally ended, Chelsea beamed, and the entire plaza erupted into thunderous applause.

Watching the scene, Luna smiled. "Dazzling."

Before they knew it, the sun was setting, but to Luna, this sight was as blinding as the sunlight.

Leo silently watched, letting out a deep sigh in his heart.

As night fell, the group returned to their lodgings. It was time to organize all the things they had bought while exploring the festival.

Back in her room, Luna sorted through her belongings. Most of them were related to magic. 

She glanced at the magic books she was writing in the corner of the room. They contained the spells she had created after observing the mages she considered to be the future.

Smiling softly, she took out a small bottle.

"Still... this really looks like that nasty potion."

She tilted her head in curiosity.

*Knock, knock—*

"Come in."

Leo opened the door and stepped inside.

Luna flinched and quickly looked away.

"Hey. You remember confessing to me, don't you?" Leo asked, narrowing his eyes.

Luna immediately scowled. "What nonsense are you spouting?" 

Leo smirked. "Don't bother playing dumb. I know you remember everything from when we took down Zodiac in your Hero World."

Luna frowned, realizing she had been caught. Then, after a moment of frustration, she scoffed. "Fine! I remember! So what?!"

"Why'd you lie and say you didn't?"

"Because you were acting too smug about it, and it pissed me off!" Luna shouted.

Leo's face twitched. "And what was that nonsense earlier? Thanks to you, the whole street is now saying I was in love with you!"

"That's great!"

"You could've just told the truth! Why spread ridiculous rumors?!"

"I will make it the truth! I'll brainwash everyone! I'll convince them all that you loved me!"

"You thug."

"I confessed to you while enduring so much embarrassment! How could you be so indifferent about it?!"

"Why wouldn't I be? If you'd just shown it openly back then, none of this would've happened."

"Ugh! You're so frustrating! Then how did you even figure out Lysinas liked you?! She was way more subtle than me!"

In truth, Lysinas had shown it. Luna had just been too oblivious to notice.

"I found out from a letter she left behind."

"So you didn't know while she was alive?"

"Yeah."

"Ugh! Seriously! Why did I even fall for this idiot?! And why did she like this idiot?!" Luna stomped her feet in frustration.

Leo chuckled. "The one who falls in love loses."

"One more word, and I swear I'll kill you." Luna growled. "I even kissed you on the cheek when I confessed! Give me my confession back!"

"Say something that makes sense. And what's the big deal about a kiss on the cheek?"

"It is a big deal! Lysinas would never have done something like that!"

"Never? She stuck her tongue in my mouth."

*Crack—!*

Luna was so shocked that she instinctively clenched her fist. 

The bottle in her hand shattered into pieces. Naturally, its contents splattered everywhere, drenching Luna.

She was so stunned that she opened and closed her mouth like a fish. 

Then, she lunged at Leo, grabbing his collar and shaking him violently.

"When?! When the hell did that happen?!"

"When we met in her Hero World."

"Liar! There's no way that prim and proper Lysinas would do something like that! You must've forced yourself on her! That's it, isn't it?!"

"Not at all."

"That means she was just some perverted dragon!"

"Or maybe you're just hopelessly naive," Leo teased, smirking.

Already furious, Luna grabbed his collar even tighter and shook him even harder… when suddenly, while they were so close and struggling, they both felt something strange.

*Ssshhhkk—*

A sound like something melting.

Leo noticed the odd sensation first. "Wait. What's wrong with my clothes?"

"Don't try to change the subject!" Luna—her ears now burning red—glared at him and screamed.

Leo's heart sank. "Hey, hold on. What exactly was that thing you just broke?"

"Some love potion or whatever. I bought it because it looked like some weird perverted concoction that old bastard made."

"...What?"

For once, Leo looked genuinely unsettled. He immediately pushed Luna away.

*Squelch—*

Luna, finally realizing something was wrong, looked down at herself. Seeing her clothes slowly melt away, she screamed in horror, "What the hell?! Why is this actually working?!"

"Carl, you goddamn son of a bitch..." Leo clicked his tongue, realizing exactly who was responsible.

In the end, Leo and Luna were left completely naked.

"Who even invents something like this?! I'm gonna kill that perverted old dwarf!"

"He's already dead."

"THEN I"LL KILL HIM A SECOND TIME!"

Luna's enraged voice echoed through the room.
