The preparation period for the dormitory competition mock battle was one month.

And during that period, Lumene entered its exam season.

"Yeah! This is what an exam period should feel like!"

Before the start of magic class, Carl jingled his now-heavy pockets with a delighted expression. "I love exam periods! My earnings double compared to usual!"

Watching Carl happily counting his earnings, Chloe rested her chin on her hand and asked, "You like it that much?"

"Of course! I wish every day was exam season!"

"Would you still like it after seeing your report card?"

"That's exactly why I wish every day was an exam day!" Carl beamed. "That way, I wouldn't have to get a report card at all."

Chloe shook her head as she watched him.

"Carl! Do you have any stamina recovery potions left?"

"No, they're all sold out."

"Damn."

The student who had asked looked disappointed. Over the past year, Carl's stamina recovery potions had proven their effectiveness. Because of that, they had become a staple for nearly every student.

"But," Carl smirked, "I do have a new product."

"A new product?"

"Yeah. I stayed up several nights straight making this one." Carl puffed up with pride.

The male student narrowed his eyes. "You could've used that time to study."

"Heh. Do you really think studying would get me out of last place?"

"Good point."

"Hey, you could've denied that a little harder."

Slumping his shoulders, Carl opened his spatial pocket and pulled out a small bottle.

*Tap—!*

He placed a tiny vial, about the size of a thumb, on the desk and grinned meaningfully.

Seeing that, even Chloe looked intrigued. "So, what does this potion do?"

"A concentration-boosting potion. Drink this, and your focus skyrockets for 24 hours!" Carl grinned. "What do you think? Since it's a prototype, I'll give it to you for free..."

"I refuse." The male student rejected him without hesitation. "I have no interest in being a test subject for one of your experimental potions."

Carl let out an awkward laugh at the blunt response. "It's not harmful or anything. Just has a few side effects."

"Hah. I figured as much. Alright, what are the side effects?"

"For 24 hours, you won't be able to sleep no matter how hard you try. Afterward, you'll have to sleep for two whole days straight. And when you do wake up, you'll still be so out of it that you won't be fully functional."

"So that's why you were completely out of it last weekend?"

Chloe recalled the past weekend and shook her head.

"Absolutely not." The male student refused coldly.

Even the other students who had shown interest turned away from Carl's new product.

Seeing this, Chloe gave him a puzzled look. "It's not like you to just confess the side effects so honestly."

"Hey now! Business is built on trust! What do you take me for? Have you ever seen me pull a scam?"

"You've never scammed anyone. But selling a prototype potion with unresolved side effects is bound to hurt your business later, isn't it?"

"Of course." Carl nodded confidently. "But soon enough, you'll all be begging me for this."

Carl wiggled his fingers as he twirled the potion. The golden liquid inside the small bottle shimmered.

Chloe remained unimpressed. "I don't feel any urge to drink it."

"Yeah."

"Who'd want to drink something with those side effects?"

Jeers erupted from all around.

"This potion was made using a recipe straight from Dweno's Alchemy Book."

"What?"

"Did you just say Dweno?!"

Students widened their eyes and turned to Carl. Even Abad and Chelsea, who had been talking nearby, looked shocked.

By now, everyone knew that Carl had obtained Dweno's Alchemy Book as his conquest reward.

When the Exclusive Smith Contract Workshop ended and Lumene students returned, even upper-year magic students had flocked to him. They had begged him to share the alchemy book's contents, and eventually, Lumene's queen, Elena, had to step in.

> "If anyone keeps making a fuss over Carl's conquest reward, I'll make sure they regret it."
>
> "Don't be ridiculous, Elena Zeron! That's an abuse of student council authority! Do you really think Hark will agree with you?"

Fifth-year mages, who already disliked Elena, had fiercely opposed her.

> "Oh? I'm not speaking as a student council member. I'm issuing this as a directive in my capacity as the Lumene board chairman's proxy. And besides..." Elena's eyes gleamed. "Do you really think Senior Hark will take your side in this? If you have a problem, you don't need to wait for Hark. You can come at me right now."

Although only a fourth-year, Elena had inherited the title of Lumene's strongest mage after Torua graduated. Not just the strongest in the magic department—she was considered the strongest student, on par with Hark.

With her overwhelming background and power, the chaos surrounding Carl had died down.

And now, with everyone curious, Carl was outright advertising his potion as a product of Dweno's recipe. Naturally, every student in the lecture hall focused on him.

"Now then! The effects of this potion are simple. It boosts concentration for 24 hours!" Carl lifted the potion like a street vendor hyping his wares.

"But the side effects? After 24 hours, you'll be mentally out of it for two whole days! And! You'll forget almost everything you studied while under its effects!"

"Aww, come on."

"That completely ruins it."

Some students reacted with disappointment.

"Tsk, tsk. While the potion is active, your memory retention skyrockets thanks to the enhanced concentration. In other words..." Carl's eyes gleamed. "It's perfect for cramming! I guarantee its effectiveness! It worked wonders for memorization!"

"...!"

Some students flinched.

"You could breeze through the last written exam just by drinking this!"

"Ooooh...!"

"That's actually...!"

Students looked tempted.

Seeing this, Chloe frowned. "Hold on. Isn't that basically doping? Isn't it against school rules?"

"Sure, in practical exams, using potions that temporarily boost abilities is considered doping. Those kinds of potions have severe side effects, too." Carl shrugged nonchalantly. "But this potion? Nope! It's just a study aid, like an energy booster. An energy booster!"

"Still, this feels wrong." Chloe was flustered.

By now, Abad and Chelsea had joined her, nodding in agreement.

"Chloe's right. You should avoid causing unnecessary trouble."

"Brother's right."

"Ugh!"

"Get lost, you perfect-score students!"

"You guys don't understand our suffering!"

Students booed as Chelsea crossed her arms. "Instead of wasting time on this, why don't you just read your textbooks again? Leo, you think—wait? Where's Leo?"

Chelsea looked around, realizing Leo had disappeared.

Meanwhile, Carl continued his sales pitch like a street vendor.

Then, a moment later—

*Bam—!*

"Student Council!"

"We received a report about illegal drug manufacturing and sales in this room!"

The classroom doors burst open as burly student council members stormed in.

Carl's mouth opened and closed in shock.

"Arrest him!"

"You are hereby detained for illegal drug manufacturing and distribution violations!"

As he was handcuffed and dragged away, Carl sobbed and begged for forgiveness.

Watching this, Chloe sighed. "But how did the student council find out so fast?"

"I reported it," Leo replied. He had gone away and returned at some point, without anyone noticing.

"You did?"

"Yeah. If people took that potion during exams, it'd be a problem."

Chelsea burst out laughing.

*Oh right, he is the student council president.*

"Power really is nice to have."

{sep}

After the commotion died down, fortunately, with Leo's help, Carl was released with just a warning.

"Sob, sob! I thought I was going to be tortured after getting dragged to the student council! Leo! Thanks, man!" Carl expressed his gratitude to Leo.

Chloe shook her head inwardly.

*I wonder what kind of face he'd make if he knew it was Leo who got him arrested in the first place.*

*Creaaak—!*

The classroom door opened, and Professor Len and Assistant Professor Anna entered.

"Greetings, everyone!"

"Hello, Professor Len!"

The students responded in unison with bright voices. Seeing them, Len smiled in satisfaction.

"Before we begin the lecture! I will now announce the topics for the magic department's written exam and assignment for the midterms!"

At Len's words, all the magic students widened their eyes. Seeing their reactions, Len smirked meaningfully.

"The topic for this midterm's written exam is the spell formulas of Artificial Creation!"

Artificial Creation was a field that involved creating something through a combination of magic and engineering.

"And the assignment is none other than creating a familiar using Artificial Creation!"

At Len's announcement, the students began to murmur.

"Professor! When you say creating a familiar using Artificial Creation, do you mean a golem or a chimera?"

"Exactly!" Len nodded. "And! For today, I have invited a renowned magician in the field of Artificial Creation just for you all!"

Grinning confidently, Len turned to Anna. "Assistant Professor Anna! Please bring them in!"

"......"

Anna hesitated with an uneasy expression. Seeing this, the students started to tense up.

Even the unshakable Anna was hesitating! That could only mean one thing—Len had brought in someone extremely dangerous.

As everyone's faces grew more serious, Anna walked over to the classroom door and carefully peeked outside. "Come in."

At her words, the door opened, and a woman with pale skin stepped inside.

Her eyes, sunken from dark circles, carried a hollow gaze. Her gray hair was unkempt, as if she hadn't brushed it in days. She wore a faded white lab coat, giving off the distinct appearance of a reclusive researcher uninterested in social interactions.

But what stood out the most were the pointed ears peeking through her messy hair.

"An elf?"

"An elf? That's rare."

As the murmurs spread—

"This here is Tina Tingel," Len introduced.

The students' eyes widened.

"She is the greatest mind in the field of Artificial Creation and—most famously—the descendant of Seiren Tingel, the founder of Seiren!"

At the introduction, Tina Tingel stepped forward.

"Nice to meet you, hero candidates of Lumene," she said in an utterly exhausted voice.

"Just to check..." Raising one hand, Tina spoke. "Is anyone here interested in dissection?"

The students gave her odd looks.

"No one? What a shame. I was hoping to find a volunteer."

Clicking her tongue in disappointment, Tina scanned the room.

Internally, everyone screamed.

*What the hell is up with this elf?!*
