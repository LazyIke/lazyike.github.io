*What's wrong with him all of a sudden?*

Leo narrowed his eyes as he observed Thamus's sudden shift in demeanor.

As if unable to believe what was happening, Thamus stood there, dazed, mumbling things like, "This is impossible! This can't be happening!"

*He was crazy before, but at least he wasn't acting like he'd completely lost his mind.*

[The title of hero has been revoked at your discretion. The name of the Nether Knight Thamus has been erased from the Hero Record.]

"What?"

Seeing the message suddenly appear before him, Leo's expression twisted in shock.

A situation too absurd to comprehend.

Leo instantly understood why the Twilight Knight had suddenly started acting strangely.

*This is ridiculous.*

Publicly, the Hero Record was known as the last gift left by the gods when the Age of Calamity ended 5000 years ago.

But in truth, the owner of the Hero Record was none other than the Hero of the Beginning, Kyle.

*Well, since I had already died and disappeared, the gods have been managing the record for the past 5000 years.*

Even though they had departed from the mortal realm, there was no way the gods had completely lost interest in the world.

*Back in the Age of the Gods, they chose this world as their playground partly because they were bored, but also because they genuinely loved it.*

They could no longer intervene, but it was certain that they were still watching over the world. That was why anyone who caught the attention of the gods could have their name recorded in the Hero Record.

The thing was, while gaining the gods' recognition was no easy feat, once someone was chosen by the gods, their personal character didn't matter—they would be revered as a hero regardless.

*Trying to understand how those beings think is pointless.*

In the present era, people worshipped the gods, but for those who had actually lived through the Age of the Gods, they were often seen as little more than a nuisance.

That was why Leo couldn't acknowledge someone as a hero simply because the gods had recognized them.

*None of these people here are truly worthy of being called heroes.*

Leo narrowed his eyes as he looked at the members of the Justice Guild.

*But even so... I have the authority to revoke a name from the Hero Record?*

Thinking back, it wasn't just the Book of Shadows. The records of past heroes from the Age of Calamity, even before the Hero Record was created, had been added to it at Leo's discretion.

*If I have the authority to record names, it's not strange for me to have the authority to erase them as well. But still, this is an absurd level of authority.*

Leo had the power to grant and revoke the title of hero at will. In the Age of Heroes, this was an unfathomable power—no, a divine authority.

*If this gets out, won't they start worshipping me as an actual god?*

Leo let out a dry chuckle.

*This is too much responsibility. I'm not Lysinas.*

"What an interesting conversation. So, you're saying you're the Hero of the Beginning?" Jerome laughed as he looked at Leo. "You call yourself a Great Hero from 5000 years ago just because you're an All-Class?"

"I've never gone around calling myself Kyle," Leo replied indifferently. "It's just that idiot rambling on his own."

The moment Leo turned his gaze to Thamus...

"You dare... What did you do to me?!" Thamus roared in fury.

*Goooooooh—!*

With his outburst, the atmosphere trembled, and the executives of the Justice Guild shuddered.

A terrifying bloodlust radiated from Thamus's body.

"Ugh!?"

"Kuh...!"

The overwhelming pressure contorted the faces of the Justice Guild members.

Jerome narrowed his eyes.

*He's comparable to a legion commander.*

It was a power on par with the legion commander they had defeated in the Hero World.

"As expected of a hero who once carried an era. Defeating you will be worth it."

"This isn't the time to be saying things so casually, is it?"

"What?"

"You guys don't seem capable of handling him. Wouldn't it be wiser to run away?" Leo crossed his arms and spoke nonchalantly.

Seeing Leo's attitude, Jerome curled his lips into a smirk. "How arrogant. Just because you became the student council president in your first year and earned the title of hero in your second, do you think you're untouchable?"

Powerful spiritual energy surged from Jerome's body.

"No matter how much you act like you're above everyone else, you're still just a kid. If you overestimate yourself, you won't live long..."

"Kraaaaaaah!"

*Kuwaaaaaang—!*

Before Jerome could even finish speaking, Thamus, having drawn his sword from the subspace, charged straight at Leo, and his greatsword, cloaked in jet-black aura, came crashing down on him.

*Whooooosh! Kwaaagagagang—!*

Leo was sent hurtling straight into the ground.

Seeing this, Jerome's expression changed.

*I didn't see the attack. Did he use spatial movement?*

It was a strike far beyond Jerome's perception.

"Our opponent is a hero who once carried an era. Consider him a monster on the level of a legion commander."

At his words, the executives of the Justice Guild quickly formed a battle formation.

They were seasoned heroes who had conquered countless Hero Worlds. Having endured and overcome numerous trials, they were able to remain composed even in the face of Thamus's overwhelming power.

"Should we assume he's as strong as a Sword Saint?" Chain asked.

Jerome nodded. "Yeah."

*Flash—!*

Countless light elementals were summoned into the air.

"Then, let's dispense justice."

{sep}

*Kuwaaaaaang—!*

Leo's body crashed into the ground, creating a deep crater.

"Kyaaaaah!"

"W-What is that?!"

Buildings collapsed, and screams rang out from all directions.

*Thud, thud, thud—!*

As Leo pushed himself up, chunks of debris tumbled down around him.

"He's definitely strong."

*Crack—*

Leo twisted his stiff neck from side to side, brushing away the rubble as he stood. The place where he had landed was none other than the royal palace.

As everyone stood frozen in shock, staring at Leo, who had fallen from the sky, Crown Prince Jeremy rushed toward him in a panic.

"Sir Leo! What's going on?!"

"Ah, Jeremy, perfect timing." Seeing a familiar face, Leo smiled. "The Nether Knight has been resurrected as an undead."

"The Nether Knight?"

Jeremy's face contorted in disbelief. The Nether Knight was a name he knew well. No, anyone living in the northeastern continent would know that name.

Still, hearing that a hero from 3000 years ago had been brought back as an undead was hard to believe.

Jeremy quickly shifted to a serious expression. "What should we do?"

It hadn't been long since he met Leo, but as the future ruler of a kingdom, he had an eye for people. He knew Leo wouldn't say something so outrageous unless it was true.

"If things go badly, this entire capital could be reduced to rubble."

"The entire capital?!" Jeremy's face turned pale.

"Yeah."

*That guy is stronger than the Sword Saint.*

Comparing the Nether Knight to Sword Saint Kalian as a *hero* was absurd. To Kalian, it would have been nothing short of an insult.

As a *warrior*, however, Thamus was undeniably powerful.

If Leo fought him head-on, leveling a city wouldn't be out of the question.

"We need to evacuate the citizens to safety as soon as possible."

"I will command the soldiers and lead the people to a secure location." Jeremy said resolutely.

"You could die, you know?"

"The lives of the people come first."

Leo chuckled as he looked at Jeremy's firm expression. "I like you."

"I heard reports that an army of the dead is attacking from outside the capital. How should we handle that?"

"There's someone fit to lead the troops. Lily."

"Yes, Master!"

"You're from a military family, so you've received command training, right?"

"Not much, but I have. Of course, compared to you, Master, it's nothing. Ah, there's just so much to learn from you..."

Leo coolly ignored Lily, who was once again putting herself down, and turned to Jeremy. "Would it be alright to leave the city's defense to Lily?"

"To Lady Lily? I should seek royal approval for military authority..."

"You mean Lily, a mere hero candidate?" a condescending voice interrupted.

The King of Carnel approached, flanked by a group clad in white armor and robes.

"The Justice Guild?" Leo frowned in confusion.

"The Justice Guild has just declared that they will protect our nation from the wicked invasion of Tartaros," the King of Carnel spoke with confidence.

Leo let out a dry laugh.

"Father, even so, we must evacuate the people to safety."

"Hmph. Do not spout nonsense. Light Seeker Jerome and the Brave Heroes of the Justice Guild will vanquish the ghost of the past, the Nether Knight. Evacuating the people without cause will only lead to chaos. The Justice Guild members have already been deployed throughout the capital to reassure the citizens. Do not act recklessly!"

At the King of Carnel's words, a Justice Guild member added, "Our guildmaster and the executives will soon bring news of victory."

Leo looked up at the sky. "That doesn't seem likely."

*Goooooooooh—!*

A storm of aura erupted from the Nether Knight. The violent blast instantly erased a knight-class hero at the frontlines, leaving no trace of him.

"Guh...!"

"H-He just...!"

Cries of terror broke out among the Justice Guild members.

*Whoosh—!*

Then, the Nether Knight drew a golden greatsword from the subspace and swung it.

*Thwack—!*

Someone's head was effortlessly severed.

"Ah...!"

"Ch-Chain!"

Chain, a renowned mage hero and the vice guildmaster of the Justice Guild, had been slain.

At the sight of this, panic spread through Justice Guild.

Sensing the shift in morale, the King of Carnel urgently shouted, "Heroes of Justice Guild, hurry and assist them..."

But before he could finish his sentence, the Justice Guild members turned and fled.

"W-Wait, you!"

The King of Carnel called after them desperately, but they quickly vanished.

*Should I say it's fitting for those who climbed the ranks of heroes by accumulating karma?*

Leo narrowed his eyes. Even if their leaders had fallen, the Justice Guild members still held the title of hero.

Yet, they were fleeing without hesitation.

*Did the gods knowingly choose such trash as heroes? They have awful taste.*

"Y-Your majesty, what do we do now?" One of the ministers asked in a panic.

King Carnel's body trembled.

"To the Warp Gate! Gather the treasures!" he shouted urgently, but before he could leave, Jeremy stepped in his way.

"What are you doing?! Move aside!"

"Father, may I take command of the military?"

"In this situation, you dare utter such nonsense?! Move!"

"If you're not going to use that authority, why not just hand it over to your son?" Leo asked, standing beside Jeremy.

King Carnel flinched at Leo's cold smile. "D-Do as you wish! Just let me pass!"

At those words, Jeremy bowed his head, and Leo stepped aside.

"Then, Your Highness, I leave the ground forces to you. I'm going to deal with that bastard."

"If you join forces with the Justice Guild, can you take him down?"

"They'll probably just run away. Or die quickly." Leo answered flatly.

"You intend to fight that monster alone? This country has no ties to you. Why?" Jeremy asked in disbelief.

Facing the Nether Knight, who even the Justice Guild failed to stop, was nothing short of suicide.

If Leo chose to retreat here, no one would blame him. In fact, many would probably prefer that the promising Leo survive.

Yet, Leo was choosing to fight this enormous threat.

At Jeremy's question, Leo answered indifferently. "If there's someone threatening people, there should be someone saving them too."

"Is that your belief as a hero?"

"No, it's something a friend once said." Leo smiled slightly. "That lady didn't see it as a belief either. More like common sense."

"Common sense?"

"Yeah. It balances things out, doesn't it?"

Was there ever a special reason behind the malice that threatened people? If not, then there didn't need to be a special reason for the kindness that saved them either.

That was how the world kept turning.

"Someone who can stand against that senseless evil without needing a reason—that's a hero."

A hero wasn't special because they had some grand cause. They were special simply because they chose to act.

With a chuckle, Leo called out, "Anya."

At Leo's call, Anya and the Shadows revealed themselves.

Jeremy flinched at their sudden appearance.

"Your orders?"

"Do what the heroes couldn't."

"What?" Anya, who had been bowing, looked at Leo in confusion.

"Didn't you say the role of Shadows is to do what heroes cannot?" Leo grinned. "Countless heroes abandoned this city, so it's obvious what the Shadows should do."

"You mean...?"

"It's time for you Shadows to protect the city that the heroes abandoned."
