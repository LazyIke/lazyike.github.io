The Plov family's territory was a peaceful rural estate, home to vast vineyards that produced high-quality grapes. The wine made from those grapes was quite popular within the kingdom.

"Ohh, this wine cellar is amazing," Carl exclaimed in admiration as he looked around the Plov family's wine cellar.

"Isn't it? I was getting bored waiting, but at least there's some good wine to enjoy."

Hearing a voice from one corner of the wine cellar, Carl turned his head. When he saw the mage standing there, his eyes widened in surprise.

"Senior Torua?"

"Hello, Carl Thomas. Juen told me she owed you a lot."

Torua, a mage from the Southern Magic Tower, looked at Carl, the mentor of the Magic Tower Master's daughter Juen, with a favorable expression.

"I only did what I was supposed to do as a mentor," Carl said, his face flushing red.

"Why are you so excited?" Leo asked.

"Hey, Leo! It's Senior Torua! Senior Torua!" Carl's voice was filled with excitement as he whispered to Leo. "She was ranked first or second in popularity among the magic department students alongside Senior Elena until last year!"

"So what?"

"Unlike Senior Elena, who was too scary for anyone to approach, Senior Torua was kind to many juniors. Even in my first year, it was hard to even talk to her properly, but now I get to meet her like this after she graduated."

Torua had been the vice president of the student council and one of the top five strongest students in Lumene, making her an unapproachable figure for first-years. Especially for Carl, who had spent most of his time as the lowest-ranked student in his grade.

Seeing Carl's emotional expression, Leo shook his head.

Torua, smiling at Carl, put down her wine glass and approached him. "You're a good junior who knows how to respect your seniors. Look, Leo, learn something from your friend. What's with that indifferent attitude toward your department senior?"

"I'm not in the magic department, though."

"Well, I suppose you're busy with student council work. Either way, I'm happy that the student council president this time is from the magic department."

Leo let it slide. He already knew that Torua was not someone one could reason with.

Torua stretched out her hands and clasped Carl's, smiling. "Carl Thomas. I'd like to repay you for helping Juen."

The mature aura she exuded made Carl feel a little flustered.

"You don't need to."

"No, I insist. Since you're skilled in alchemy, how about conducting some potion experiments with me?"

"It would be an honor to be taught by you, Senior Torua!"

"Good, Carl. What do you think is the most fundamental trait of a mage?"

"Curiosity?"

"Great, excellent. And what is the act that allows us to pursue that curiosity?"

"...Experiments?"

"Wonderful, wonderful." Torua clapped her hands in admiration.

Scratching his head, Carl chuckled awkwardly. The way Torua looked at him, eyes gleaming with excitement, made her seem more like a child despite being older.

"Then what's the most important thing in an experiment?" she asked.

"Research, I suppose?"

"No, it's test subjects."

"……" The moment she said that, Carl had a bad feeling.

"Carl, you inherited Dweno's alchemical texts, didn't you? Were there any potions in there that were too dangerous or too ambiguous to test without a subject?"

"No, none at all."

"That's a lie." Torua, who had already decided on an answer, smiled innocently at Carl.

Carl didn't hesitate—he turned and ran. But he was caught immediately.

"Le-Leo! Help me!" he screamed.

"Heeheehee! You're not going anywhere." Torua cackled like a witch as she grabbed the pale-faced Carl.

Watching his struggling friend, Leo spoke with sympathy. "You won't die."

"Leo's right. I wouldn't kill a junior. It might feel like dying, though."

"That's even worse?!"

Leaving behind Carl's terrified screams, Leo exited the wine cellar. If he stuck around, Carl would inevitably drag him into it.

Leo knew better than anyone that a mage fixated on research was one of the most troublesome beings in existence.

*Kyle, let's do some magic experiments together.*

He shook his head as he recalled Luna, smiling brightly while holding all sorts of experimental tools in her hands.

A short while later, Carl, who had barely managed to escape from Torua, stepped out of the wine cellar and asked, "What is Senior Torua even doing here?"

"I heard she was invited as an instructor for the training camp."

"Senior Torua is?"

"Yeah. Along with Brother Rhys, Senior Ulta, and Senior Jamua."

Hearing that last year's graduates were coming as instructors, Carl clicked his tongue. "Don't tell me graduates from other hero academies are coming too?"

"Probably."

"This is going to be insane." Carl shook his head.

Not just Lumene, but last year's graduates from Seiren, Azonia, and Damien had all made a name for themselves after graduation. And now, all of them were coming together.

"I just hope this doesn't turn into another school rivalry."

Leo, who had planned this training camp through Melina, smirked inwardly.

*No, that's exactly why I invited them.*

That evening, the second guest arrived at the Plov Family's estate.

"Hmph, this place is a complete backwater."

Standing in front of the mansion's entrance, Eliza scoffed lightly before knocking on the door.

A moment later, the door opened, revealing Reina.

"Oh my, and who is this lovely young lady?"

"Hello, my name is Eliza Hergin."

Eliza maintained proper etiquette as she greeted Reina, knowing that Reina was a senior who had graduated from Lumene long ago.

"Ah, I remember now. You're a summoning department student, right? Come on in."

Reina, greeting Eliza warmly, invited her inside the mansion. As they passed through the entrance and headed to the living room, Leo and Carl were already there.

"Oh, Eliza," Carl greeted casually.

"Hmph, so you got here first, Carl Thomas." Eliza scoffed at the familiarity.

"You're early. We weren't supposed to gather until tomorrow morning."

"I can't stand being in crowded places. Not that I enjoy being around you either... but I figured you'd come early, Carl Thomas." Eliza spoke in her characteristic sharp tone, then turned to Reina and greeted her. "Thank you for guiding me, Reina Plov."

"You must be tired from traveling. Get some rest."

Since the Plov estate didn't have a Warp Gate, visitors had to travel long distances from the neighboring territories.

"I appreciate your consideration."

As expected of the heir to a prestigious hero family from the northern continent, Eliza bowed gracefully, then approached the sofa in the living room and sat down beside Carl.

Watching this, Reina covered her mouth and chuckled.

Eliza casually inspected her nails and spoke. "Tea."

When Carl stared at her blankly, she added, "I paid for a term-based errand service from you for the next semester, didn't I?"

"Oh, that doesn't apply during vacation."

"Hmph." Eliza reached into her coat and pulled out a white piece of paper between her index and middle fingers.

"I'll serve you with the utmost sincerity, my lady."

Snatching the check, Carl hurried off to get tea.

"Leo Plov, since this training camp is taking place in your estate, I assume you've discussed things with the Dragon Lord to some extent," Eliza said, still tending to her nails. "What's the plan for the camp?"

"The goal is for everyone to get a little closer to their ideal. In your case, your objective is to form a contract with a pegasus, right?"

"Hmph, just because you formed a contract with one, you make it sound so easy."

"Aren't all the preparations done?" Leo smiled. "You already have the medium and the contract candidate, don't you?"

The Hergin family had made contracts with the Three Great Summons for generations. Among them, Eliza had the aptitude to become a pegasus contractor. As Leo said, ever since she became the heir, the pegasus she would contract and the necessary medium had already been prepared.

"You just need to be ready yourself, right?"

"You..." Eliza was about to snap at Leo's taunt when...

"You shouldn't do that, Leo. Eliza is simple-minded, so if you provoke her, she'll recklessly do something dangerous."

"Kyaaah?!" Eliza shrieked in surprise at the voice that suddenly came from beside her. 

Before she knew it, Chen Xia was sitting right next to her, smiling brightly.

"Xia! How many times have I told you not to sneak up on me like that?!" Eliza's voice shot up in pitch as she glared at Chen Xia

Chen Xia placed a hand on her cheek. "But Eliza, you're so cute when you're startled."

"Please don't find me cute," Eliza grumbled, looking slightly drained by Chen Xia's oddly sadistic gaze.

"What's going on?"

Hearing Eliza's scream, Reina entered the living room.

Standing up, Chen Xia performed the traditional Eastern greeting of wrapping her right fist with her left hand. "Hello, Reina. My name is Chen Xia. We met before—do you remember me?"

"Of course I do. I've heard a lot about you since then."

"Has Leo told you about me often?" Chen Xia asked with wide eyes.

Reina shook her head. "No, Carl did."

Carl, who had returned carrying a tea set, flashed a V-sign at Chen Xia. 

As he set the tea in front of Eliza, Reina asked, "So, Xia, what's your relationship with my son?"

"I dedicate my body and soul to serving Leo."

"Pfft—! Cough, cough!" Eliza, who had just taken a sip of tea, sputtered it out involuntarily. "What?! Your *body* and *soul*?!"

Carl smirked mischievously and said, "Leo is Xia's benefactor. What were you imagining—ugh?!"

Eliza elbowed Carl in the ribs.

Reina, listening to Chen Xia's words, covered her cheek with one hand, looking slightly troubled. "Son, first Celia was serving you as a maid, and now an older girl says she's dedicating her body and soul to you? I'm starting to worry about your tastes."

"A maid? What are you talking about?" Carl, still holding his side, widened his eyes.

Leo sighed. "Celia lost a bet and was forced to serve as my maid for a while. And Xia just does whatever she wants, no matter what I say. What does that have to do with my preferences?"

"What about Celia?"

"What about Celia Zerdinger?"

Chen Xia and Eliza both perked up at the name.

Reina giggled, "Last year, Celia played the role of Leo's maid for a while. She was so cute. I even took pictures—want to see?"

Chen Xia beamed. "Yes! That sounds adorable!"

Seeing Chen Xia's excitement, Reina went to fetch the photos. Even Eliza, despite herself, waited for Reina with interest.

Watching the two, Leo muttered, "My classmates really get along well."

"What part of this looks like 'getting along' to you?"

"Aren't you guys always looking for ways to tease each other?"

"And that means we're close?"

Carl looked dumbfounded, still clutching his ribs.

"Of course."

*Tomorrow's going to be chaos.*

Carl shook his head as he imagined Celia screaming in outrage.
