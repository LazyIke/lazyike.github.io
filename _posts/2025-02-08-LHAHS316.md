As exam season approached, the students grew busier.

Chen Xia stood in front of the Glory dorm's stronghold, her brows furrowing. "...I feel like something's missing. What do you think our stronghold is lacking?"

Hearing her murmur, Chloe folded her arms and fell into deep thought. It wasn't just Chloe. The magic students working on the defensive towers around the stronghold also paused, considering her words.

Eventually, they all spoke in unison.

"Firepower?"

"And then what? Are you saying we should increase firepower? The purpose of a stronghold is defense, so we should focus on defense," Chen Xia sighed, turning to Leo. "What do you think, Leo?"

"This is enough."

At Leo's reply, Chen Xia glanced back at Glory's stronghold. "If it were me, I think I could slip in."

"There's no one in our grade who can infiltrate like you. So, we'll be fine."

"Right. That's true." Nodding in understanding, Chen Xia listened as Chloe gathered the Glory students.

"All our preparations are complete." Chloe looked at Leo. "Leo, as soon as the test starts, you and the others attack Noble's stronghold. I'll attack Harmony's stronghold with Chen Xia." She turned to Eliana. "Eliana, you stay and defend our stronghold."

Eliana pouted. "I want to go with the class rep to attack."

Chen Xia laughed. "Eliana, you'd definitely charge in recklessly, so I think you should defend."

"Ugh." Eliana groaned, seemingly at a loss for words, drawing laughter from the Glory students.

"Anyway, the showdown is three days away. Get plenty of rest until then. Keep yourselves in top shape."

At Chloe's words, some of them grumbled.

"How are we supposed to rest when we have written exams coming up?"

"Right! You have no idea how tough it is to manage our condition like this."

Chloe tilted her head, confused. "Studying for the written exam can be done with what you've studied already, and you can fit it in between preparing for the practical, right?"

Chen Xia smiled. "That's possible because it's you, Chloe. Normal people can't do that."

"...You managed it, Chen Xia." Eliana muttered, exasperated.

Chen Xia beamed. "I only slept about thirty minutes a day. I was trained for that."

Eliana shook her head. "...If Chloe's amazing, you're terrifying."

"If you need help studying, let me know."

"Whoa!"

"Chloe!"

"Goddess of Ice! Ice Queen! Ice Witch!"

"Who just called me a witch!" Chloe shouted, her face turning red.

Lumene was packed with people.

Principal Rina stood at the stands, watching the audience filling the seats, and massaged her temples as if she had a headache.

"Why does the board insist on making me a figurehead at these events? As a shadow, powerful people usually don't even like me." Grumbling irritably, Rina looked to Yura, who nodded in agreement.

"That's what I'm saying. Why do I have to do this? For once, I'm dressed all prim and proper..."

Usually, Yura wore sensuous outfits, but today, she was dressed in a modest, ladylike style.

Len, noticing, commented, "If Senior Yura would only keep quiet, you'd look perfectly respectable."

"What do you mean, 'if I keep quiet'?!?"

"Don't you understand? Then allow me to explain in detail so even you can—"

Veins bulging on her forehead, Yura grabbed Len by the collar. Officials who had come to greet them scattered in fear.

Rina cackled, enjoying the scene, while Ain let out a long sigh.

"Principal, shouldn't you stop your professors from making a scene instead of laughing at them?"

"They're actually keeping away annoying people. Isn't that nice?"

Ain pressed his hand against his forehead. *I miss Kallian. Even if he was a lazy principal who pawned off his work on the faculty, at least at public events, he provided some dignity.*

Rina was more diligent than Kallian, but she despised such events.

Suddenly, she spotted the first-year students, who had just finished their practical exam, receiving cheers from the crowd.

This year's first-year midterm practical was a special labyrinth dungeon, artificially created by the professors rather than a Hero Dungeon. The team that cleared the labyrinth fastest scored the highest points.

"I see. Aina Beidna. As I'd expect from Kallian's great-granddaughter?" Rina narrowed her eyes at Aina, standing proudly in the training field. "She got first place in the knight exam too, right?"

"Yes, apparently," Ain replied. "By a tiny margin, she beat Haviden."

"What about the other departments?"

"There were no surprises. Summoning's top belongs to Sasha, who won the Summon Race. Magic's top belongs to Juen, who dominated the magic battles."

"Hmm." Rina stroked her chin thoughtfully. "What about Leo Plov's mentee?"

"Luke Eldar placed mid-high in the written exams but dead last in all the practical tests."

"...I guess that's to be expected."

"Yes. He works harder than anyone, but..."

Rina smirked. "I bet the Student Council President's up to something. We'll see about the finals."

Ain nodded as Rina glanced at the time.

"You guys should go get ready."

"Yes, of course."

Ain nodded and glared at the two younger professors, who were still brawling.

"Let's go, you idiots."

"Who are you calling an idiot?"

"Senior Ain, you want me to clarify so you can understand—"

"Shut it."

Grabbing them both by the scruff, Ain dragged them away, and Rina shook her head.

*Ain's going to age quickly.*

At Noble's stronghold, Abad gathered the dorm students.

"According to Carl's intel, Glory will have Chloe and Chen Xia attack Harmony's stronghold while Leo attacks ours. Thinking it necessary, I shared this info with Celia."

"Did you really have to do that?" Tade looked suspicious.

Abad explained, "Our dorm and Harmony have a non-aggression pact. We won't fight each other until we bring down Glory. Given that, it's best to concentrate all our power on attacking Glory's stronghold. That's what I think."

Eliza filed her nails. "And even so, if the forces are split, it's hard to completely destroy the enemy stronghold."

"Right. Chloe will likely send their main force out quickly, aiming to secure kill points. That means the question is who they chose for King..." Abad rubbed his chin. "Carl, what do you think?"

Carl scratched his head. "If I were Chloe, I'd pick Leo as King."

"Why?"

"He's the most reliable."

"...Certainly, with Leo Plov's agility, he can make swift retreats."

Eliza narrowed her eyes. "Should we target Leo Plov?"

"No. Leo's mobility is too high. Sure, I can chase him in the air, Duran on the ground, you in water, but..." Abad's eyes narrowed. "Leo's agile in all terrains. If we try to kill him head-on, we'll just take losses."

Abad shook his head and unfolded a map.

"It's better to knock down their stronghold, and Celia probably thinks the same. We'll use our main force to strike Glory's front. Emio, you take a group around to the rear. Hit them from behind."

At Harmony's stronghold, Celia briefed her dormmates.

"You'll likely meet up with Noble's separate squad behind Glory's stronghold. If they stick to the agreement, don't fight them—attack together. Of course, it won't be easy to break it all at once, but if we inflict serious damage, Glory won't be able to fight effectively."

"A non-aggression pact, but ironically an alliance," Nella mumbled.

Celia shot her a sharp look. "If we gain an advantage against Glory, we'll soon face Noble in battle. Don't drop your guard."

As the strategy meeting wrapped up—

*Fweeeeeee—! Boom—!*

Signal flares soared over Lake Lumeria.

"All right, let's move!" Celia commanded.

The second-years began to mobilize.

Leading the Noble students around to the rear of Glory's stronghold, Emio glanced up. "Lovely weather."

He smirked. A thick fog cloaked the lake, perfect for a stealth approach.

Suddenly, up ahead, he sensed a presence.

The Noble students tensed.

"Is that Harmony?"

"Yeah, must be. Emio?"

"Nella, right."

Emio frowned. "That scoundrel Abad said he trusted your side's leader, so the plan's on. You and Celia Zerdinger are on good terms, I guess."

Nella offered her usual lazy smile. "They've known each other since childhood."

"Until Glory falls, let's get along. Our squad will lead the way, so just follow us." Emio stepped forward.

"What's with him, acting like he's in charge?" a Harmony student grumbled.

Nella chuckled. "Military families care about who takes the first capture. So let's just play along."

Shrugging, she led her dorm after Noble.

At the front, Emio muttered inwardly, *Ugh, it feels like everything's going Abad's way.*

This test had heavy strategic elements. He'd hoped to shine, being heir to a military lineage, but everyone unanimously chose Abad as commander.

He could live with that. The real problem was—

*Why make Carl, of all people, the adviser?*

Carl had provided perfect details about enemy movements, and that grated on Emio's nerves.

*I almost hope his intel is wrong.*

He was still stewing over it when—

*Swoosh—!*

A presence appeared up ahead.

Emio smirked. "Hah, guess Carl messed up."

"What?"

"It's Glory."

At his words, the Noble students hurriedly braced for combat.

Likewise, Harmony's students prepared for battle.

"Interesting. Let's see who they are," Emio said, gathering mana for a spell.

His opponent finished casting first.

*Fwooooosh—!*

Not only that, the magic was powerful.

"What?!" Emio's eyes widened at the sudden attack.

*Kwoooom—!*

Scorching flames instantly evaporated the fog and engulfed him. He tried to raise a defense, but the fire was faster.

*Whoosh—!*

He died on the spot and was sent to the respawn point.

"You should've kept your guard up," the attacker sighed.

As the fog parted, Nella gasped.

"Leo?"

"Why is he here?"

"Was the intel wrong?"

Instead of attacking Noble's front, Leo had been waiting behind them.

The fog closed in again, concealing him.

"Check for a presence!"

"How many from Glory are here?!"

"I can only sense one person!"

"You don't mean..."

Harmony and Noble students wore tense expressions.

"He's alone?"

"Correct."

*Wooooong! Fwoooosh—!*

A pillar of flame erupted, making their faces go pale.

*Kwoooom—!*

A massive surge of fire roared forth.
