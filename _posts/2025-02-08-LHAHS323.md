A pillar of flame shot into the sky, piercing the heavens.

*SPLASH!*

Flung backward, Celia barely managed to steady herself by driving Flame Storm into the ground. Her eyes locked onto Leo as he approached, Lancea once again in hand. She clenched her teeth.

*He hasn't even had Lancea for that long…*

Powerful weapons were tricky. Mishandle them, and the weapon might end up controlling you instead. Celia had spent a long time mastering Flame Storm. Yet in just a few days, Leo was using Lancea deftly.

Her grip tightened around the hilt of her sword.

*Come to think of it… he's always been like that, ever since we first met.*

His swordsmanship had always overwhelmed her. His raw physical ability was staggering. And his knack for instantly harnessing aura and wielding the Zerdinger flame was uncanny. If anyone knew this best, it was Celia, who had spent more time by Leo's side than nearly any other second-year.

*We've trained together for so long.*

More than anyone, she understood the gap between them. No matter how much she chased after him, that distance never shrank. The more she tried, the more it crushed her. After their very first encounter, she had never truly wanted to fight him seriously. She had kept running after him, yet in her heart, she had already conceded defeat.

But now, in front of everyone, Leo was the one challenging her in earnest.

*I can't back down.*

*FWOOSH—!*

Flames erupted around Celia, gathering at the tip of her rapier.

*Prominence.*

From the start, she unleashed every ounce of firepower she had. Flame Storm, bestowed with the phoenix's will, blazed fiercely. As long as her resolve burned, that sword would never break, rust, or dull.

*SWISH!*

A blade of fire carved through the air, hurtling toward Leo. He spun Lancea in response.

*WHOOSH—! WHOOSH-WHOOSH-WHOOSH! BAM!*

Lancea whirled at breakneck speed, devouring Celia's flames.

*FWOOSH—!*

The spear flared even brighter. Celia's face stiffened.

*My strongest flame…!*

"Flames get devoured by a stronger flame, Celia."

Her jaw clenched.

"Especially if it's the *same* flame."

Leo also wielded the Zerdinger flame. Moreover, as the phoenix's contractor, he stepped forward. Celia instinctively stepped back.

"Well, the real reason is…"

*FWOOSH—!*

Flames rose around Leo's body.

*You're convinced you can't win.*

"Urgh! Shut up! That's not it!"

Enraged, Celia lunged.

*SWISH—!*

She drew a parrying dagger from her coat, one that Leo himself had once suggested she carry to improve her close-range combat. As a knight, she already held overwhelming area-of-effect firepower, but adding a parrying dagger further refined her close-quarters prowess.

*CLANG—!*

She intercepted Leo's thrust and countered, aiming for his neck.

*WHOOSH—!*

But he pushed in, slipping past her blade, closing the gap.

*CLANG—!*

Leo drew a parrying dagger of his own.

"Ugh?"

Allowing him to get this close was a mistake. Celia gritted her teeth, regripping her rapier. But Leo had already dropped Lancea and seized her wrist.

"You're not the type to give up so easily."

"Who said I gave up?"

*THUD—!*

Her aura burst outward, flinging Leo back. He tumbled through the air.

*BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM—!*

A barrage of wind blasts struck at Leo from behind. He spun midair, gathering aura at his fingertips.

*FWOOSH—!*

The gusts scattered.

*Tap—!*

"Wow! Wow! As expected of you, Leo! So amazing!" Chelsea clapped in admiration. 

Celia ground her teeth, furious. "Chelsea! This isn't the time to take Leo lightly! This is a test!"

Chelsea flinched. "What? I've never taken him lightly, you know?"

"Then take this seriously! Did you think that weak magic would work on him?!"

"What? You! That wasn't weak! You…!"

Just as Chelsea bristled at Celia's sharp tone…

*WHOOSH—!*

Leo raised a single finger toward her.

*WHOOOM—!*

A tremendous mana surge erupted.

*SWOOOOSH—!*

"Gah?!"

Chelsea instinctively squeezed her eyes shut.

*Wind magic!*

Panicking, she dispelled the magic and shot upward to escape.

"Chelsea!" Celia's face went pale.

Chelsea barely caught sight of Leo. He was coming straight for her.

She had no time to dodge.

"Wind Shield!"

*BOOOOM—!*

Wind clashed against wind, creating a deafening sonic boom.

*FWOOSH—!*

The shockwave blasted across the field, flattening grass and tearing up the earth.

"Aaagh!"

"What the hell was that?!"

The students attacking Glory's fortress were caught in the turbulence.

*CRASH—!*

"Something's flying in!"

"Is it artillery? What's going on?!"

The fortress wall shuddered under the impact. As the dust settled, Chelsea's form was revealed.

"Urgh!"

"Ch-Chelsea!"

Harmony students rushed toward her.

"It's Leo!"

Their faces went rigid in terror. Leo was charging straight for Chelsea.

*SWISH—!*

At the last second, a spear flew between them, halting Leo's approach.

"Howl!"

One of the top knights among the second-years, Howl Neif, stood between Leo and Chelsea. Poison aura coiling around his spear, he fixed Leo with an unwavering stare, his technique sharp as a striking serpent.

Leo smiled. "You look cool. Almost like a knight protecting his king."

Scowling, Howl brandished his spear.

*SWISH—!*

"Celia's quite the strategist, you know."

Scholar and warrior combined—that was the motto of an honor student worthy of the Zerdinger name, the ideal Celia strove to uphold.

"Chloe told me," Leo said with a slight grin. "She said that if Celia had her way, she'd pick Chelsea as king since Chelsea's the fastest in second year and can slip free of skirmishes."

Sending Chelsea to the front had been meant to obscure that fact.

"Judging from your reaction, it's true."

Leo let out a faint laugh and swept Lancea behind him.

*CLANG—!*

Flame Storm clashed against Lancea, sparks flying. Seeing an opening, Howl lunged with his spear.

*SWISH—!*

Like a serpent striking its prey, the spear twisted unpredictably toward Leo.

*BAM—!*

Leo kicked it aside.

"Kuh?"

Howl staggered back, and in that instant, Leo slammed a fist into Celia's abdomen.

*BOOM!*

"Gah?"

Fire aura shrouded his punch, doubling Celia over and sending her flying.

Leo shifted his gaze to Chelsea.

Students from Harmony, who were supporting Chelsea, gasped.

"R-Run! Run!"

"Protect Chelsea!"

"Chelsea, get away!"

If the king fell, Harmony would be eliminated on the spot.

Ordinary students rushed Leo.

Celia, forcing herself upright despite the pain, clenched her teeth. *I never imagined we'd be under pressure this early in the exam.*

Normally, even if someone realized Chelsea was the king, the situation wouldn't escalate this fast. They had chosen Chelsea for the very reasons Leo mentioned—agile, difficult to pin down, and strong enough to break free even under duress. Not even Warden or Celia could easily catch her.

That was why Chelsea had been chosen, but…

*That guy…!*

Celia bit down hard. Once again, she was reminded of how Leo's abilities surpassed anything they had anticipated.

*He said I think I can't win?*

Her hands trembled.

*That's not… I never… never…*

Her eyes wavered.

"Celia!"

Howl's urgent voice snapped her out of her daze.

"Leo's going after Chelsea! We have to stop him!"

"Got it!"

Ignoring the pain in her gut, Celia sprang to her feet and rushed after Leo.

One by one, the Harmony students attempting to protect Chelsea were swept aside.

Chelsea, seeing Leo closing in, braced herself and mustered her mana. *He thinks I'm taking this lightly? That's not true! I just… because…*

Simmering inside at Celia's remark, she was struck by another raging storm.

Leo was using wind magic to completely dominate her.

Buffeted by violent winds, Chelsea barely managed to open her eyes.

Expressionless, carrying his spear on his shoulder, Leo advanced. A chill ran down her spine.

Now she understood what Celia had meant by having a "light heart."

At the same time, Harrid's words echoed in her mind.

*Do you plan to chase after those two forever, or will you find your own path?*

The question resurfaced.

*CRASH—!*

Another storm raged near Chelsea. She barely dodged, catching a glimpse of Leo's indifferent gaze.

She had always looked up to him, admired him from afar.

But now, the gap between them was brutally clear.

She had never believed she could beat him. Like Celia, she had always known how vast the chasm was.

She had thought just watching from a distance was enough.

*I can't see him anymore.*

Even if she reached out now, it was too far.

*What am I supposed to do…*

Her eyes trembled.

"Chelsea?"

A familiar voice.

"Brother."

Another figure she admired.

Abad frowned, concern in his eyes, as he ignited his mana.

*BOOM—!*

He deflected Leo's magic and shouted, "Celia!"

Celia, who had caught up behind Leo, flared her aura of flame.

"I don't like teaming up with you, but…"

Sparks danced in her eyes.

"This is our only option!"

*FWOOSH—!*

Fire and wind. Among the second years, that combination could unleash devastating power.

"Prominence."

"Tempest."

As Celia's aura fused with Abad's mana, a massive fiery storm erupted. Raising her sword high, Celia shouted, "Prepare yourself, Leo!"

Leo answered by summoning aura and mana.

*FWOOSH—! SWOOSH—!*

A vortex of fire and wind swirled in his hands.

"Haaah!"

Celia roared, swinging Flame Storm at Leo.

*BOOM—!*

Where the raging conflagration met, the land was engulfed in flames.

{sep}

As the flames subsided, Chelsea stared blankly ahead.

"Chelsea."

Abad gave a bittersweet smile and reached out to pat his sister's head.

"Brother…"

"Maybe it's time for you to spread your wings."

His smile remained pained.

Declared dead, Abad vanished.

*THUNK—!*

Lancea, which had lodged in his back, dropped to the ground.

Celia's hands, shaking violently, gripped Flame Storm.

She glanced down. Her palms were burned and bleeding.

Yet those hands had still managed to block her attacks.

"You said you never thought you couldn't win, right?"

Leo tightened his grasp. 

As if responding to the victor's will, the beloved sword's flaming blade cracked.

*CRACK—! FWOOSH—*

Broken by Leo's strength, Flame Storm's blade scattered into embers.

Celia grimaced in agony.

"Had you had enough yet?" Leo asked mercilessly.

The badly injured Celia took an unsteady step back. The light on her life-display bracelet dimmed.

"Chelsea." Celia turned to Chelsea. "Run!"

*FWOOSH—!*

Declared dead, Celia was teleported away.
