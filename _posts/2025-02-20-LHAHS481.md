"Look up at the sky right now!" Lily shouted, bursting through the thicket in a hurry.

Upon spotting Artkan standing off against Leo, her expression hardened.

"A demon?"

*Fwoosh—!*

Closing the distance at an incredible speed, Lily swung her battle hammer at Artkan's head.

*Craack—!*

With a thunderous impact, the grass and trees around them bent in opposite directions from the force of the strike.

*He didn't even budge?*

Despite taking a direct hit from such a powerful attack, Artkan's expression didn't change in the slightest. He hadn't even bothered to defend or brace himself. It was as if Lily's attack had done nothing at all.

Artkan turned his gaze toward Lily. "You shouldn't interrupt when adults are talking."

He spoke with a gentle smile, and the sight of it made Lily's entire body break out in goosebumps.

*Thump—!*

As Artkan grasped Lily's hammer, crimson sparks erupted.

*Crackle—! Slash—!*

Artkan's wrist was severed.

*Shaaah—!*

As he watched his hand crumble into sand and scatter, Artkan turned his gaze toward Leo.

"Don't you dare touch her," Leo warned, his voice carrying a deep, murderous intent.

"T-Thank you, Master." Lily quickly put distance between herself and Artkan, securing a safe range as cold sweat ran down her back.

"Master, huh..." Artkan chuckled, intrigued. "Hohoho! Hahaha! I see. So that girl is like those two."

"Those two?" Lily looked puzzled at his words.

"Master, do you know this demon?" Lily asked in a bewildered voice, hearing the familiarity in Artkan's tone.

"Haha, we share quite a deep connection. In a way, you and I now have a connection as well."

A chilling bloodlust emanated from Leo's body. "Don't spout nonsense." 

Unconsciously, Lily took a step back.

Seeing him, Artkan bowed his head. "If I have offended your ears, I sincerely apologize."

*If I provoke him any further, this will truly be dangerous.*

Having served as the Lich King's confidant for five thousand years, Artkan knew Leo all too well. With the Nether Knight as a major threat in play, Leo wasn't the type to recklessly attack just to settle an old grudge.

*But if I push him further, he'll do whatever it takes to kill me.*

The reason Artkan hadn't addressed Leo as the Surviving Hero was to avoid provoking him unnecessarily.

*He's different from when we met in Xian six months ago.*

Leo was regaining the power of his past life at an astonishing pace, and that pace had accelerated even further due to the conquest rewards he had obtained from Dweno's and Lysinas's Worlds.

*He's still not at his peak yet... but he has more than enough strength to annihilate me.*

Above all, he was the Hero of the Beginning, Kyle, a man who had perfected the art of hunting demons, and the Great Hero that demons feared the most.

Five thousand years ago, Artkan had fought against every Great Hero at some point, but the battle he remembered with the deepest terror was his fight against Kyle.

As an All-Class, Leo wielded an incredibly diverse range of skills. Against other Great Heroes who specialized in a single field, there were always openings to escape. But against Leo, it was nearly impossible.

"Well then, I have set the stage, so I shall take my leave." Artkan curled his lips into a smirk and faded into the darkness.

Watching him disappear, Lily asked, "Who was that?"

Even at a glance, it was clear he was no ordinary demon.

"The Archduke of Mourning."

"Gh...!"

*Clench—*

Her grip tightened around her sword.

Leo sighed. In his past life, it was none other than Artkan who had turned Bihar into an orphaned soldier, and also Artkan who had killed Velkia's parents when was still an infant.

If that wasn't bad enough, high-ranking necromancers enslaved the very souls of those they killed. Later, Artkan turned Bihar's fallen comrades into undead just to torment her. He even resurrected Velkia's long-forgotten parents as undead, shattering her heart.

*Bihar, Velkia... I'm sorry for being such a pathetic master.*

Leo closed his eyes and took a deep breath. "Lily."

"Yes."

"I'd like you to be the one to bring him down."

Lily looked startled at the sudden request, but as she stared at Leo, who was glaring at the spot where Artkan had vanished, she noticed that his profile looked not just angry, but sorrowful as well.

Seeing that, Lily spoke with firm resolve. "Yes! I will make sure to defeat him!"

At her determined response, Leo smiled slightly.

*Woooooooong—!*

Just then, a sinister aura stirred in the sky. A mass of jet-black aura was gathering in one place.

*He's going to launch a strike at the capital?*

Leo lowered his stance. If an attack of that magnitude struck the city, countless people would die.

*Woooooooong—!*

As a gray aura coalesced around Leo's body.

*Flash! Kwooooom—!*

A pillar of pure white light struck down from the heavens.

The Nether Knight swung his greatsword irritably, slashing at the pillar of light.

*Boom!*

The jet-black aura and the white pillar clashed and veered off course, colliding with the capital's outer walls.

*Kwooooom—!*

The city walls crumbled as if they were nothing.

"A light elemental?" Seeing it, Lily muttered in shock.

Leo narrowed his eyes and turned his gaze in another direction. Standing there was a man clad in a pure white robe, leading a group of seven.

Noticing the insignia embroidered on their billowing robes, Leo muttered, "The Justice Guild."

{sep}

"Oh?" Thamus let out a murmur of admiration as he looked at the people blocking his path. "So, there are at least a few useful ones among the heroes of this era."

"It is an honor to meet you. Are you the esteemed Senior Nether Knight?"

"And who might you be?"

"I am the Light Seeker, Jerome. Though lacking, I serve as the guildmaster of the Justice Guild."

"A guild... You mean the hero organizations of this era?"

"You are well-informed." Jerome smiled warmly. "But unlike the other seniors who began appearing yesterday, you seem to be in remarkably good condition, senior."

Jerome looked at Thamus with an intrigued expression. "Seeing the dead heroes suddenly resurrected as undead made me think about several things."

"And what did you think?"

"The Lich King has suddenly gained immense power. And using that power, he has resurrected heroes as undead. Most likely, those who lacked the qualities of a hero fell into undeath. Also..."

"Also?"

"There would be undead like you, who have retained their minds. And those individuals... would have betrayed the world." Jerome shrugged. "After all, you were once a coward who turned your back on the world's crisis, weren't you?"

*Kwooooom—!*

Jet-black aura surged toward Jerome, but the dark energy was blocked by a shield of blue aura.

A knight, armed with a bastard sword and shield, stood firmly in front of Jerome.

"Not bad." Thamus's lips twisted into a sneer. "You said your name was Jerome? Watch your tongue. I am merely using the Lich King."

"Using?"

"Yes. He believes he can control me with his power." Thamus raised his hand.

*Woooooooong—!*

A powerful surge of deathly energy radiated from his palm.

*Gwooooooooh—!*

A moment later, a deafening roar rang out.

Jerome's gaze turned toward the outer walls of the city. Countless undead were rising from the ground.

"Necromancy?"

"No, spirit calling." Thamus chuckled. "They are the mighty warriors who once ruled the continent at my side. It is the Lich King's power that has resurrected them, but they still swear their loyalty to me. He cannot exert his dominion over me. Rather, my mind is the one controlling his power."

*Tap—*

Thamus readjusted his grip on his greatsword. "Remember this, Jerome. Just because someone's name is in the Hero Record doesn't make them a true hero."

From beneath his hood, Thamus's eyes gleamed. "Those who used the Hero Record's power to inherit the strength of past heroes and take the title of hero so easily—can they really be called heroes? No, you are nothing but mass-produced fakes."

Thamus scoffed in derision. "The weak-willed heroes, and fakes like you, may become slaves to the Lich King. But I am different."

"I agree that not everyone in the Hero Record is a true hero." Jerome let out a small laugh. "But the rest of your argument is baseless nonsense. So, what is your goal now that you have returned?"

"First, I will raise a legion of spirits and exterminate Tartaros. Then, I will unify the continent and rule this world as an immortal hero. It is the duty of a great hero to lead the wretched slaves down the correct path. And by doing so, I will prove that the foolish Dawn Dragon was wrong to have chosen the Twilight Knight over me."

"Haha, so that's why you abandoned the world in its time of crisis? How utterly pathetic." Jerome smirked mockingly.

Thamus swung his sword.

*Kwooooooom—!*

A massive black slash roared toward Jerome, threatening to cleave him in two.

*Flash—! Kwooooom—!*

However, a grand white barrier absorbed the slash. The moment Thamus's attack was absorbed, it was sent right back at him. It was a spell cast by the Justice Guild's vice guildmaster, Chain.

"Hmph, Seiren's magic—Counter Shield, is it?"

Observing the spell, Thamus smirked and pointed his sword forward.

The jet-black slash was drawn into Thamus's blade.

Chain narrowed his eyes at the sight. "Guildmaster, that sword..."

"Yes... It's Nox, a divine sword crafted by Lord Dweno."

Nox, a legendary greatsword created by Dweno during the Age of Calamity, inspired by the beauty of the night sky.

"A Hero Weapon?" One of the knight heroes among the Justice Guild's executives showed a glint of greed in his eyes.

"You wield fakes granted by the Hero Record, but none of the treasures I possess are mere imitations." Thamus sneered. "This sword is an authentic relic left by the Divine Blacksmith."

"As expected of the man who once built the mightiest empire in history. You seem to have quite a collection of treasures." Jerome stroked his chin. "This will make taking you down all the more worthwhile."

"You think you can defeat me with your power?"

"This party has even slain a legion commander in the Hero World. Do you truly believe you can win against us?"

Jerome unleashed spiritual energy. Countless light elementals emerged into the air. His expression turned cold. "Thamus, betrayer of the world. As a hero of this era, in the name of justice, I will eliminate you."

"It is the duty of a true hero to lead the world. Fake heroes who ascended through the Hero Record are unnecessary in this world."

As a massive aura swirled around Thamus...

*Wooooooong—!*

The black sword, Nox, reacted.

"Hm?" Thamus's eyes twitched.

*Fwoooosh—!*

In an instant, golden flames erupted.

"Ugh?!" Thamus reflexively let go of Nox as searing heat burned his hand.

*Whooooosh—! Clang—!*

As Nox plummeted toward the ground, someone caught it.

At that moment, the jet-black blade shimmered with starlight, then transformed into the image of a beautiful night sky.

Resting Nox on his shoulder, Leo clicked his tongue. "You lot sure love running your mouths with the same old annoying bullshit."

"Leo Plov." Jerome narrowed his eyes. "This stage is not yet meant for you."

Ignoring Jerome's words, Leo rose into the air to meet them at eye level. "Does it sound like I give a crap about that?"

Jerome let out a quiet laugh. "Your attitude toward a senior is incredibly rude."

"I've never had a senior like you, though?" Leo replied indifferently, then turned his gaze toward Thamus. "So, you're the Nether Knight?"

"......" Thamus silently stared at him for a moment, then said, "Those eyes... That way of speaking... I see. That bastard was telling the truth. You're exactly the same as the person I saw in the Hero World."

Thamus's lips curled into a respectful grin. "I've been looking forward to meeting you, Hero of the Beginning. My name is Thamus, and I am your true successor."

At Thamus's sudden declaration, the members of the Justice Guild widened their eyes in shock. They couldn't comprehend what they had just heard. For the first time, the arrogant Thamus had displayed respect.

Leo dug his ear with his pinky, as if he thought he had heard wrongly too. "What? Say that again?"

"I said, I am your *true successor*."

Leo's jaw dropped in disbelief. "You're crazy."
