Upon receiving Melina's message, Leo secretly left the training grounds and arrived at the mountain peak.

"A Hero Dungeon appeared, and black flames erupted?"

"Yes. We need to go to Dellan right away."

"Alright. But who's that next to you?"

Leo pointed at the girl standing beside Melina—a girl with golden hair and golden eyes. Though she appeared human, Leo could immediately tell she was a dragon. 

Despite the presence of an unfamiliar dragon, he treated Melina no differently than usual for a simple reason.

*If this dragon was brought here by Melina, she wouldn't question our relationship.*

It seemed she didn't know about Leo's true identity either.

The dragon girl stood still, her expression carefully controlled, though faint curiosity flickered in her eyes.

Melina smiled. "Her name is Enkinas. I call her En. She's still young, but she's incredibly wise and intelligent. She serves as a librarian of Dragonia."

At the mention of Dragonia's librarian, Leo glanced at En again. Since Lysinas had been called the Wise Queen, the dragons of this era took great pride in pursuing knowledge. Because of that, the archives of Dragonia were a treasure trove of wisdom, containing countless tomes collected by dragons.

Moreover, the Hero Records of dragons were also stored in Dragonia's archives. In dragon society, the position of Dragonia's librarian was only granted to a select few.

*Wasn't it a position reserved for Dragon Queen candidates?*

"En, this is Leo Plov. Show him proper respect."

"It's an honor to meet you, Leo Plov. My name is Enkinas." En lifted the hem of her dress slightly and curtsied.

Melina shook her head. "En. You should be using the traditional dragon greeting."

"Oh, right." En awkwardly pounded her right chest three times as a formal greeting.

"It's still a bit unnatural for you. I told you to practice."

"I apologize, your majesty."

*You're not exactly one to talk.*

"So, why are you introducing her to me?" Leo asked.

"En has a special ability," Melina replied.

"A special ability?"

"Yes. En."

At Melina's cue, En stepped in front of Leo and locked eyes with him. Her golden irises reflected Leo's face like a mirror. The next moment, a brilliant light burst from En's entire body.

As the light faded, Leo was standing there.

"Oh?"

"My mana attribute is Copy. This magic is my unique spell, Mirror."

When illusion magic is used to alter one's appearance, there is always some sense of unnaturalness. However, En's magic was so flawless that it didn't even feel like an illusion. It was as if Leo was staring at his own reflection.

"So, she'll be standing in for me when I'm away?"

"Yes."

*If Melina arranged it, I can trust her.*

For Leo, she was just an inexperienced junior, but Dragon Queen Melina was a dragon who led the world. If it was her work, then there was no reason to doubt it.

"Then I'll be counting on you, young lady."

Leaving his substitute behind, Leo used Warp with Melina and headed to Dellan.

{sep}

Despite the appearance of a Hero Dungeon and the eruption of black flames, the capital of Dellan remained as peaceful as ever.

As they made their way toward the dungeon site, Melina asked, "If the flames were the Flames of Calamity, does that mean it's the Dawn Records again?"

"That's the most likely possibility."

The fragments of Erebos, sealed by the Heroes of Dawn, constantly sought a way back into reality through the Hero Records.

"If we defeat the Flames of Calamity again this time, do you think we could purify them into divine power?"

"Maybe."

Leo had already faced fragments of Erebos in the Hero World.

*Luna's World, and Seiren's World.*

As Leo recalled those Hero Worlds, his eyes narrowed. So far, two fragments of Erebos had been identified.

*One fragment of Erebos was sealed inside a Hero Record, and another is dormant in Fairyland.*

"Now, I think I have a pretty good idea of where the third fragment of Erebos is."

Melina's eyes widened. "Where?"

"The third fragment of Erebos is probably in the Lich King's hands."

Melina's face hardened. "The Lich King?"

"Yeah. Considering how he was able to use the Flames of Calamity back then, it seems almost certain."

The Primordial Evil, Erebos's flames were akin to divine power for the demons. Just as mortals couldn't generate divine power, demons couldn't create the Flames of Calamity on their own.

And yet, the Lich King, who had invaded Lumene at the time, had spewed the Flames of Calamity.

"Is that... alright?"

"He can't awaken it immediately."

"Why not?"

"If a fragment of Erebos had been revived, the Lich King wouldn't be sitting still. But at the same time, he wouldn't be foolish enough to openly expose an unawakened fragment of Erebos either."

"Then?"

"He's probably obtained the fragment but doesn't know how to awaken it or harness its power. The flames he produced back then were merely a reaction to my presence. He won't be launching an attack using Erebos's fragment anytime soon... though we can't afford to be complacent either."

Leo took a deep breath.

*I need to regain the power of my past life as soon as possible.*

With that thought, he stopped walking.

They had already arrived at the research institute.

"It's quite noisy inside."

"Of course. A Hero Dungeon must have formed."

As Melina thought aloud, she waved her hand. The space distorted. She stepped forward, and the massive walls rippled like water.

*A spatial distortion, huh?*

It was a spell truly worthy of the Dragon Queen.

Ignoring all obstacles, Leo and Melina arrived at the site of the Hero Dungeon.

"Is it confirmed that no one got caught inside the dungeon?"

"Yes!"

"Report to the royal palace immediately and request reinforcements from the hero academies..."

"That won't be necessary."

"...What?!"

The commanding officer, who had been barking orders, flinched and turned his head. Melina stood there, smiling.

"We're here from Dragonia."

"D-Dragon...?"

"Yes. We will be investigating the Hero Dungeon."

After saying that, Melina glanced at Leo.

Leo approached the Hero Dungeon and extended his hand toward the distorted space...

[Hero Record Open.]

A now-familiar message appeared before him.

[Aaron's World. Chapter: Final Chapter – The End.]

"What?" Leo's face froze.

It was a completely unexpected page.

*Fwoosh—!*

The scenery shifted.

*Crackle—!*

Black flames blazed wildly.

Now, Leo understood why the dungeon's appearance had been accompanied by the eruption of black flames.

Hero Dungeons encroached upon the world. Thus, there were times when the dungeon's internal events manifested outside.

The black flames were fragments of that fire.

Leo inhaled sharply. The smell of a burning world stung his nose as a landscape of utter despair unfolded before his eyes.

It was a sight all too familiar to Leo.

How could he ever forget?

To others, this scene was the tragic yet legendary tale of the Great Heroes' final stand, but for Leo, it was nothing less than a nightmare.

Here, in this very place, Kyle had lost one of the friends dearest to him, more precious than life itself.

"Haaah!"

A battle cry rang in Leo's ears.

*Flash—!*

A golden aura surged high into the sky. The mighty sword strike of the Brave Hero, Aaron.

*At this moment... Aaron was braver than anyone.*

In his final moments, Aaron embodied the name of the Brave Hero. Even as he stepped onto the battlefield, he remained resolute.

Though he had sacrificed himself out of fear of watching his friends die... In his dying breath, he comforted his weeping comrades, because he never doubted that they would save the world.

To ease their worries, Aaron smiled.

That was why Leo never knew what Aaron looked like in his final stand against Erebos. All he had ever seen was Aaron's back—charging forward without hesitation.

The Brave Hero who stood alone against the Primordial Evil.

And now—Aaron's last moments, unknown to Leo, were unfolding right before his eyes.

"Aa...ron?"

Unconsciously, Leo spoke the name of his fallen comrade.

Aaron, clutching his broken Brave, turned toward Leo.

*Fwoosh—!*

The Flames of Calamity surged toward Aaron to consume him.

Leo sprinted toward him.

*Fwoooosh—!*

"Lysinas! I need you to defend!" Dweno shouted urgently.

*Fwoooosh—!*

Pure white flames erupted.

*Kwaaang—!*

Lysinas clenched her teeth. Despite nearly losing her life, Luna kept her eyes closed and continued chanting. She knew her comrades would protect her, and so, with an unwavering heart, she fulfilled her role.

*Flash—!*

A blinding white light flashed in the sky. Kyle, his sword imbued with Innocence, unleashed his aura. A massive slash struck Erebos's neck.

*Fwoooosh—!*

"Ugh?!"

"Kyle!" Dweno, his body engulfed in flames, charged at Erebos.

*Boom—!*

The ground trembled as Erebos staggered back several steps.

*Rumble—! Rumble—!*

The earth shook as if an earthquake had struck. From the impact, magma spewed forth from the ground—a battle of such magnitude that it seemed the world itself would break.

"We're running out of time! We have to keep that thing from getting close until Luna finishes her spell!" Lysinas shouted urgently.

"I'll do it."

"What?"

Aaron, who had just cleaved through the black flames, stepped forward to the front.

"Hey! You idiot! You can't do it alone—!" Kyle shouted.

"We've done the impossible before." Aaron smiled. "You've always said I was brave, right?"

"Aaron!" Dweno called out desperately.

However, Aaron didn't stop. "Now's the time for me to prove that courage. You guys protect Luna from Erebos's attacks. I'll..." 

He gripped Brave in both hands and lowered his stance.

"I'll stop him."

*Boom—!*

Aaron became a golden flash and charged at Erebos.

*Kraaaah—!*

The golden flash severed Erebos's arm.

*Flash—!*

The golden light tore through Erebos's body. Aaron's eyes widened as he squeezed out every ounce of his strength.

*Move. Faster! Stronger!*

*Kwakakakakakang—!*

At a speed too fast to perceive, Aaron slashed at the massive black giant.

At that moment, he was a god of war incarnate.

*I am the Brave Hero!*

People called him the Brave Hero, but Aaron had always found that title burdensome. He had denied it time and time again. But now, he repeated it to himself—forcing himself to embrace it for the sake of courage.

*The bravest hero in the world!*

Blood spurted from his mouth, eyes, and nose as Aaron kicked off the air.

*BOOOOOM—!*

With a sound that shook the entire world, the massive body of the Primordial Evil was hurled through the sky.

*Kwakakakakakakang—!*

As Erebos crashed into the ground, Aaron tightened his grip on his sword. "Haaaaaaah!"

*Fwooosh—!*

A golden slash cleaved Erebos in half. A blade of golden light so immense it seemed to split the heavens.

*Kzzt—! Crack—!*

The sword named Brave, symbolizing courage, shattered. Fragments of Brave scattered in the air.

"Haa... haah..."

Aaron panted heavily. Having squeezed out power far beyond his limits, his body was in tatters. His muscles were twisted, his bones shattered. His lungs were so torn that even breathing was difficult.

He realized.

*This is the end.*

He gritted his teeth. He had already prepared for this.

*I'm not afraid. Lysinas... Kyle... Luna... Dweno... will save the world! If it's for that... I'm not afraid!*

[What a pathetic Brave Hero.]

A voice, heavy with overwhelming power, echoed.

*Fwoooosh—!*

Black flames erupted.

[Even as you resolve yourself to die, you still fear death.]

Erebos's voice, filled with contempt, rang in Aaron's ears.

[Your comrades will not be able to prevent destruction.]

*Fwoooosh—!*

The black flames surged, ready to consume Aaron. His life flashed before his eyes.

[You've suffered enough through your fleeting existence. Now, disappear.]

Aaron's face twisted.

> "You don't have to dedicate yourself to the world like an idiot."

Kyle's words flashed through his mind.

> "Find something you truly want to do."

The uncharacteristically gentle voice of Kyle was the last thing Aaron heard before the indescribable fear he had been suppressing all this time finally finally surfaced and overwhelmed him.

*I don't want to die.*

He had yet to find what he truly wanted. And yet, he was supposed to die?

*I don't want to die!*

What kind of Brave Hero was he, trembling before death like this? 

His resolve crumbled. As his face twisted with terror at the brink of death...

"Aa...ron?"

A voice, unfamiliar yet strangely familiar, reached his ears.

Aaron turned around.

> "It's going to be tough from here on out."

A face from the depths of his memories surfaced. A boy who had once cheered him on.

> "There will be people you fail to save, and you'll face endless trials that may break you."

A boy who had encouraged him—his expression both apologetic and somehow sorrowful.

> "But... you'll pull through. Because you are the bravest of them all."

A boy who, despite never having met him before, placed infinite trust in him.

> "Because you saved the world."

"Aarooooooon!!"

Without realizing it, Leo screamed and reached out his hand.

He hadn't known. Not even his comrades had known.

However, the moment he saw Aaron's tearful face, he understood.

They had always believed Aaron had met death with composure, unafraid because he feared losing them more than dying.

They were wrong. Aaron had feared death more than anyone. He had only pretended to be composed.

He had acted the part of the Brave Hero until the very end, giving them courage while hiding his own terror.

The instant Leo realized that truth, he instinctively rushed toward Aaron.

Aaron, too, reached out toward Leo.

And the moment their hands touched...

*Flash—!*

With a burst of pure white light, the world froze.

{sep}

*Crash!*

"Ugh?"

"Kuhk!"

"Leo?!" Melina's eyes widened as she was about to enter the Hero Dungeon after Leo. 

The Hero Dungeon abruptly closed, and suddenly, Leo reappeared, holding someone's hand.

Melina gasped in shock upon seeing the face of the beastman youth, covered in burns and clutching a broken sword.

"You're... Aaron?"
