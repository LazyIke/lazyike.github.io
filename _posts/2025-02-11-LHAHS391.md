Behind the counter of the inn where Leo and Lysinas were staying, Tilla, the innkeeper, wiped a dish with a cloth and sighed. "There's no greater nuisance than this."

Rodia, who was helping organize the dishes beside her, tilted her head. "What do you mean?"

"Kyle and Lysinas."

Tilla shot a glare toward Leo and Lysinas, who were deep in conversation at one side of the tavern. "Because of those two, I've lost all my customers."

The Surviving Hero, Kyle, and the Fool, Lysinas.

Both were formidable warriors, and nearly everyone who fought to protect Godthrone had, at some point, received their aid. 

Yet Kyle carried the curse of losing his comrades, and Lysinas threw herself into the most dangerous battlefields in pursuit of saving the world. 

No one wanted to get tangled up with them.

Watching Tilla grumble, Rodia smiled. "But I heard you actually support them."

"...Huh?"

"Kyle said so. He told me that even though you complain, you always take care of them."

"That rude brat said that?" Tilla looked at Kyle in disbelief. "...By the way, Rodia."

"Yes?"

"You're a dragon. Why do you always speak so politely to me?"

"It just feels right." Rodia grinned.

Dragons had a long-standing tradition of guiding heroes, a role they had taken up ever since the Age of Calamity ended 5,000 years ago. Because of this, they were revered far more than other races.

Still, their status in the current era was nothing compared to their standing in the Age of the Gods. Back then, dragons had been seen as the messengers of the gods—nearly equal to the gods themselves.

So for Tilla, it was difficult to get used to Rodia treating her with such respect.

But for Rodia, it was natural. 

*She was someone from a distant past. And someone who had provided the Great Heroes with a place to rest. I can't treat her carelessly.*

With a satisfied nod, Rodia resumed her task.

*Clatter—clatter—*

Tilla stacked the dishes and spoke. "Still... they suit each other."

"What do you mean?"

"Those two." She glanced at Leo and Lysinas, who were still discussing their plans. "I didn't think they would, but watching them talk like that, they seem to get along well."

"You think so too, Tilla?"

"Yeah. If this were an era of peace, people might mistake them for a couple."

"Right? Anyone can see that Lysinas is the perfect match for Kyle!"

"I didn't say they were a perfect match."

"They're clearly destined for each other!"

Tilla sighed, watching Rodia rejoice entirely on her own, oblivious to what she had actually said.

After finishing with the dishes, Rodia hummed a tune and approached the two.

"So, you actually managed to gather this many people."

"It was difficult, and our reputation made it even harder. But we got everyone we aimed for."

"What are you two talking about?" Sliding between Leo and Lysinas, Rodia beamed as she asked.

Leo frowned at her sparkling orange eyes, which were practically glowing with anticipation. 

Lysinas, on the other hand, patted Rodia's head. "We were discussing the expedition that will take place in two days."

Over the past few days, Lysinas had grown quite fond of Rodia. Despite whatever might be inside, her appearance was that of a young dragon, and to Lysinas, Rodia was irresistibly cute.

Hearing this, Rodia turned to Kyle. "How many people will be going on this expedition to the Monster Forest?"

"Eleven."

"Eleven?! That many?" Rodia's eyes widened in surprise.

In the original timeline, the expedition team had only eight members, including Kyle and Lysinas.

Even in this bleak era, there were those who desperately sought hope. Had only the Great Heroes existed, the world would have long since fallen. But even so, there had been very few willing to join Kyle and Lysinas's journey.

Rodia had attempted numerous times to increase the expedition's numbers but had always failed. In the limited time she had, it had been impossible to change their reputations.

Yet now, the expedition had gained three more members. Looking at the list, Rodia let out a cheer. "This is amazing!"

"No, it was difficult because of Kyle."

"Huh?"

Despite securing more allies than in history, Lysinas sighed despondently. 

Leo answered matter-of-factly, "They were hesitant to join because of me, so I had to convince them myself."

"I see... Kyle, just how bad is your personality that..."

"It's true, but hearing it like that is annoying. You've really gotten cheeky these past few days."

*Crunch—!*

"Agh, that hurts!"

Leo twisted Rodia's head slightly, making her grimace in pain. 

Lysinas laughed at the sight. "You two really do seem close. Almost like a father and daughter."

Rodia's eyes went wide, while Leo scowled. 

"I'm not old enough to have a daughter this big."

"True, but the way Rodia treats you like an elder and you treat her like a child—it just gives off that impression."

"I wish Lysinas were my mom!"

Lysinas looked troubled. "Sorry, but I'm not old enough to have a child either."

"To her, you probably look old enough."

"You've been holding back on being rude lately, but I guess you can't fight your true nature."

Lysinas smiled as she spoke, but the veins on her delicate, beautiful arms were visible, and her hand had already seized Leo by the collar.

After a brief commotion, Lysinas left to gather the expedition team.

Rodia turned to Leo. "Dad, when are you marrying Mom?"

"How long are you going to keep up that creepy child act?"

"Rodia wants a younger sibling too!"

"You keep this up, and I really will hit you."

Clicking her tongue, Rodia pouted. "Why are you so excited anyway?"

"Tilla said Kyle and Lysinas are a perfect match!"

Leo turned to the counter. Tilla simply shook her head, expressionless.

"When Seiren hears about this, even that stubborn fool will have to acknowledge it."

Leo raised an eyebrow. "Acknowledge what?"

"That Lysinas and Kyle are the most compatible pair!"

Rodia's eyes widened as she spoke with an unusually serious expression.

Leo looked at her, his face clearly saying, *What nonsense is this now?*

As it turned out, Rodia's story was absurd. After conquering the Great Heroes' worlds and confirming both Luna and Lysinas's feelings, an argument had broken out over which pairing was better.

"You guys actually waste time on this?"

"It's an extremely important issue! Damien was on my side, but Azonia sided with Seiren! And Lumene, being the coward he is, stayed neutral!"

Leo sighed deeply at the sheer amount of energy his juniors had wasted on something so pointless.

"Seiren even abused her writing skills to publish some ridiculous novel to brainwash people. She's ruthless."

"...And you lot had the audacity to call me an idiot and a fool while doing all this?"

Leo pinched Rodia's cheek, making her squirm with a pout.

Just then, the door to the inn swung open, and ten people walked inside.

Leo's gaze turned toward them.

They were all familiar faces.

Comrades who had once fought by his side.

And...

*Those who had died far too soon.*

Not because they lacked strength. Not because their resolve wavered.

But simply because the battlefields they had faced were too merciless.

The air around Rodia grew heavy, her earlier lightheartedness fading as her expression hardened.

*Step—step—step.*

Nine of them took their seats, excluding Lysinas.

Most of their eyes landed on Leo.

"So, it was true." A woman with chestnut-colored hair and green eyes took a seat beside him, smiling. "Kyle, I heard you joined Lysinas's party, but I couldn't believe it until I saw it myself."

*Arlene Frielene.*

"It's been a while," Leo said.

"Well, considering we met on the battlefield not too long ago, I wouldn't say that... but yes, it has been a while, Kyle."

Despite her puzzled expression, Arlene agreed with him.

"Hah, to think we'd be traveling with the Surviving Hero," a sharp-eyed elf mage with a scar over one eye sneered coldly. "Are we all doomed to die?"

"Ha! Perique, you say that, but you still chose to sit right next to Kyle. Did his speech move you earlier?"

A beastman warrior with a massive frame dropped into the seat beside Perique, laughing heartily. His name was Allox.

"Hmph. Don't lump me in with some brainless beastman. I came here to assist Lysinas. Sitting beside this pessimist is purely out of curiosity, to see why he suddenly changed his mind."

Watching Perique and Allox, Rodia's eyes widened in surprise.

*These are the people Lysinas tried to recruit but failed.*

Lysinas had made every effort to convince them, but in the original timeline, they had refused to join the expedition.

"How did you manage to persuade them?" Rodia asked with a small smile.

Leo answered flatly, "I was briefly in a party with these two, as well as Arlene Frielene. We split up because we didn't see eye to eye."

"Hah! You were so insufferable back then, we had no choice but to part ways! Looking back, though, maybe it was for the best!" Allox slung an arm around Leo's shoulder and laughed heartily.

Leo simply took a sip of his drink.

"...You've changed," Allox muttered, tilting his head in curiosity.

Just then, Lysinas spoke up.

"This gathering is to strengthen our bonds before the expedition," she said, smiling. "And, of course, to enjoy a drink before putting our lives on the line."

"Sounds great!"

"We live for the drink!"

Laughter filled the tavern.

No one in Godthrone wanted to get involved with Kyle or Lysinas, but once they had made their choice to join them, nothing else mattered.

This was an era where every moment was life or death.

Once the decision was made, no one cared who their companions were.

Because this could very well be their last banquet.

For them.

For the world.

Everyone raised their glasses.

"Before we begin, I have a question for the Surviving Hero about this expedition," a teasing voice rang out.

All eyes turned to Kyle.

Leo rose from his seat.

"I don't mean to ruin the mood," he said calmly, "but I just heard some information about the King of Gluttony."

Silence fell.

The King of Gluttony, Jörmungandr.

The strongest of the demon commanders.

"There's a report that he's passing through the area between Godthrone and the Elf Forest."

Murmurs spread through the room.

"What? Where did you hear that?" Lysinas asked, looking flustered.

"A personal source. It's reliable."

Tension gripped the room.

Leo surveyed their reactions before speaking again. "Given the situation, delaying the expedition to prepare might be the best course of action."

"Is that what you're suggesting?" Allox asked, arms crossed.

"No." Leo's voice was steady. "I'm saying we should hunt him down instead."

A stunned silence followed.

"What?"

Everyone's eyes widened.

"The King of Gluttony doesn't lead an army. The reason he was so difficult to deal with before was that he always moved alongside another commander."

Jörmungandr was the strongest among the demons, with power beyond imagination.

But even so, traveling alone was dangerous.

Even if he intended to act alone, the moment he targeted a location, other demon forces would appear to support him.

*Five thousand years ago, the reason we didn't avoid the battle with Jörmungandr was because of this very fact.*

For the expedition team, encountering Jörmungandr had been a crisis—but it had also been an opportunity.

Lysinas had chosen to fight rather than flee, and Kyle and the others had followed her lead.

It was reckless, but miraculously, they had managed to bring down the King of Gluttony, and that victory had been the first spark of hope.

"So, I'll say this now. If any of you wish to back out, do it now."

Everyone turned to Leo.

"If what you're saying is true," Allox grinned, "then my blood's boiling!"

"This is reckless." Perique clicked his tongue but made no move to leave.

Not a single person did.

Leo had known they wouldn't.

"A battle against Jörmungandr... that's something worth risking our lives for!" Allox roared.

Leo looked at them.

*Five thousand years ago, they all died. But... not this time.*

Even if saving them now didn't mean they would live forever.

Even if, in the grand scheme of things, they couldn't escape their fates.

These warriors, who had once given their lives for the world—these people who had become the foundation of hope yet had never been able to see it for themselves...

Leo clenched his fists.

*I refuse to watch them die again. This time... I will save them.*
