The Mirror Queen Kineshi was one of the legion commanders they had defeated 5000 years ago.

Before anyone had realized, Luna's magic had already ensured that no one around them could perceive Leo, Luna, Lunia, or Kineshi. The people in the streets simply smiled as they admired the sudden bloom of flowers and passed by without a care.

As Luna worked to prevent chaos, Leo drew his sword and tightened his grip. 

In his past life, he had fought through countless battlefields, endured endless trials, and overcome them all. 

From Jörmungandr, the first enemy he and Lysinas had taken down, to Zodiac. From the Queen of Monsters to the Giant King, who had survived for 5000 years and continued to threaten the world. 

The fact that the world still stood despite such monstrous beings was nothing short of a miracle. 

Leo had fought them all, won, and in the end, he had slain Erebos to save the world.

Even without counting Erebos, he had risked his life against more foes than he could remember.

*But if I had to pick the most disgusting opponent I ever faced... it would be this damn bitch.*

The Mirror Queen Kineshi had once single-handedly driven the Great Heroes to the brink of annihilation.

"You want to settle things after 5000 years?" Leo smirked. "You already got taken down 5000 years ago. What's left to settle?"

"That victory was not achieved through your strength alone," Kineshi said, her voice devoid of emotion. "It was your comrades. Against my power, you were helpless."

Leo narrowed his eyes.

*She's right. Her ability is a pain to deal with.*

He clicked his tongue internally.

"What? Leo, why did she call you Kyle...? What does that even..." Lunia gasped, frozen in shock. Her mind refused to process what she had just heard, so she instinctively turned to Luna.

Luna met Lunia's gaze and gave her a slight nod.

Lunia's face turned pale with shock.

*Wait, if it's like that... then everything Leo's done until now makes sense!*

Even without considering his all-class status, there had always been something off about Leo. 

A human who could use Stellar Magic with ease, his overwhelming rate of growth, and his ridiculous strength, which was beyond what Lunia could even comprehend.

Now she realized—her role model, the person she had looked up to all this time, was actually the Hero of the Beginning.

Lunia was thrown into a brief panic.

*Have I been speaking so rudely to a Great Hero this whole time?!*

All the things she had said to Leo flashed through her mind, making her feel faint.

Just then, Kineshi finally noticed Luna. "Luna Luminance?"

"It's been a while. I didn't think we'd meet again after we both died." Luna stepped forward, crossing her arms with a faint smile. Her voice was calm, and her expression was composed, but the killing intent in her eyes was no less intense than Kyle's.

Leo and Luna's perception of demons was vastly different from that of the modern era. Even in the so-called Age of Heroes, this was still an era of peace. Tartaros, despite being an ever-present threat, had coexisted with the world for thousands of years.

As a result, people often sought compromises, considering the circumstances before deciding to exterminate demons. They were still enemies to be fought, but the world had learned to be flexible.

On the other hand, Leo and Luna, who had lived through the Age of Calamity, had no such reservations. To them, demons were nothing but targets for annihilation.

A low hum filled the air as Luna's killing intent grew heavier, her presence more suffocating.

Lunia swallowed hard.

*This is... the presence of the Great Heroes.*

Their very existence was overwhelming.

Luna wasn't even using mana. The sheer pressure she exuded came from nothing but her own presence. This was the existence of the grand mage who had stood against the god of destruction.

Her aura easily surpassed even Leo's, and not because Leo's presence was lacking.

Leo shot Luna a sidelong glance, narrowing his eyes. 

*Is she testing her?* 

His gaze naturally shifted to Lunia, who stood beside Luna. The girl was trembling, affected indirectly by the sheer force of Luna's presence.

Luna also glanced at the shaking Lunia.

*If this girl is to be my successor... if she is truly someone who will stand beside Kyle on the battlefield against Erebos... Then she needs to be able to endure this much.*

Aaron had been different. Though he could be harsh at times, he had always checked on Aru's condition as he pushed her.

However, Luna wasn't like that. While Aaron nurtured his disciples, pushing them forward with encouragement, she, on the other hand, shoved them off a cliff.

Her teaching methods had already been evident with Velkia. She protected her fiercely, but when it came to teaching magic, she was ruthless.

Velkia was always pushed beyond her limits by force.

Lunia clenched her teeth. 

*Get a grip, Lunia El Lunda!*

She didn't realize this was a test, but sheer stubbornness kept her standing.

*I made up my mind to stand beside Leo! I was overjoyed when Lady Luna called me her successor! After all that, if I can't even withstand pressure that isn't even directed at me, what kind of disgrace would that be?!*

She forced her eyes open and took a deep breath.

Her trembling subsided.

Luna's lips curled into a faint smile.

*She's reliable.*

"So, you're a lingering spirit," Kineshi observed, intrigued. "I must say, it's unexpected. Among the Great Heroes, I thought you were the least likely to have lingering attachments."

Luna scowled. 5000 years ago, she had played the biggest role in Kineshi's defeat. Without her, the Great Heroes would have been wiped out.

The reason was simple—Kineshi's abilities had no effect on Luna.

Even so, Luna had always found this particular demon unpleasant, because she was nothingness itself.

Most demons of Tartaros feared and hated the Great Heroes. It was inevitable. The heroes had slain their god and destroyed their destined path of destruction. They could only harbor resentment.

However, Kineshi was different.

Among the legion commanders, she was the most alien existence. She had followed Erebos's orders, but she had never cared about the destruction of the world. She had never shown hostility toward the Great Heroes, even after they had slain her god.

"What's truly unexpected is that you came back as an undead," Luna snarled.

Spirits and undead were opposite existences, but both remained in the world due to lingering attachments.

"When I died, I gained a small regret." Kineshi's lips twisted. "I became curious about the fate of the Surviving Hero."

"What?"

"The Surviving Hero was my god's only natural enemy, but I always believed he would be the first among you to die."

A ghastly smile stretched across Kineshi's face, and her eyes gleamed with twisted desire.

"His heart was already ashes. There was nothing left inside him. He was like me."

Her eyes shimmered with ecstasy.

"I wanted to see how he would meet his end. To witness the face he made as he died. Ah! Yes! Perhaps you would call this... love?"

"...You psycho," Leo spat without hesitation.

Kineshi remained unfazed.

Luna scowled in disgust. "Of all the people who could be obsessed with him, why you?"

"Good question. Why is it that every woman who claims to like me isn't normal?" Leo added expressionlessly.

Luna glared at him.

Ignoring their banter, Kineshi continued. "But after I was revived by the Lich King's power, I heard something truly unbelievable. Not only was Kyle the last one standing, he had also slain our god." 

Kineshi's expression filled with curiosity. "How was that possible?"

Leo frowned as he observed the shifting emotions on the Mirror Queen's face.

Kineshi's body started trembling, and she exclaimed, "Ah! I've become even more eager to know you. I want to understand you better. No, I am certain I can understand you."

"That's bullshit," Luna sneered coldly. "A mere demon thinks it can understand us?"

"Luna Luminance. You could never understand," Kineshi laughed. "Those who radiate boundless light could never comprehend. You, who walk your path with unwavering certainty, will never understand."

Luna clicked her tongue. This wasn't someone she could reason with.

"Surviving Hero Kyle, now I want to witness your final moments even more."

*Wooong—!* 

Kineshi's form began to shift, and Leo lowered his stance in response.

Luna's expression darkened with worry. "Kyle."

"Don't worry. It won't be like last time," Leo reassured.

Luna clenched her fists tightly.

Kineshi transformed into a massive mirror that reflected Leo.

In that instant, Leo vanished.

*Thud—! Thud—!*

And at the same time, people all around collapsed.

"What is this...?!" Lunia gasped in shock.

"It's the Mirror Queen's ability." Luna gritted her teeth. "She reflects her opponent's image and forces them to see endless illusions—either what they most desire... or what they most fear."

*Looks like she focused her entire ability on Kyle this time.*

Back then, Kineshi's illusions had no effect on Luna, because she had always had absolute faith in herself. She carved her own path. No sweet temptation, no horrifying trial could ever shake her.

"The Mirror Queen Kineshi is weak in direct combat, but her special ability is one of the strongest."

Just as Jörmungandr had been a legion commander without a legion, so too was Kineshi. 

However, while Jörmungandr had needed no army due to its sheer strength, Kineshi's ability to create illusions from whatever was reflected in her mirror made her very existence as formidable as an entire legion.

"But, if Leo is Sir Kyle, then... what kind of illusion did he see 5000 years ago?"

"......" Luna remained silent for a moment before finally saying, "He saw an illusion of fighting us."

Kineshi's illusions became more powerful the deeper one's inner darkness ran, and back then, her ability had been Kyle's worst nightmare come to life.

"In that nightmarish illusion, Kyle... killed us all."

Lunia sucked in a breath.

It was a test of faith, of belief that his comrades would never raise their blades against him. At that time, with his overwhelming strength, Kyle had cut down his closest friends.

Still, the never-ending illusion had its limits.

Luna closed her eyes and recalled the moment when she had finally struck Kineshi down.

Everyone had awakened from the illusion, but Kyle... Kyle still strangled Lysinas with one hand, his sword raised, his expression devoid of emotion, his movements mechanical.

Dweno and Aaron had barely managed to intercept his blade.

Lysinas, trapped in his grip, merely widened her eyes and said, "I'm fine, Kyle."

She had smiled gently, simply accepting everything about her friend.

*That was when Kyle finally realized it was an illusion and lowered his sword.*

Luna turned toward the place where Leo had disappeared, but her eyes didn't waver in the slightest.

*He'll be fine.*

They had overcome countless trials together. Luna believed Kineshi's ability could no longer affect Leo.

*The Kyle of then and the Kyle of now are different.*

"What about these people...?"

"They're affected by Kineshi's ability. A legion commander's power is too much for ordinary people to resist. For now, let's focus on helping them."

"Understood, Lady Luna."

Just as Luna and Lunia moved to act, a black fissure tore through the air.

*Kugugugugu—!*

Lunia's face stiffened as a woman with crimson hair, her eyes gleaming with madness, stepped out from the darkness.

Luna narrowed her eyes. "And who might you be?"

"Me?" The woman grinned wickedly. "I am the Blood Queen Elzenie. One of Tartaros's great legion commanders."
