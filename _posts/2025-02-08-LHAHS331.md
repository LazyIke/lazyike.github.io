"An exchange student?"

"Yeah, or rather, think of it as more of a short-term study abroad program."

Leo had heard about the exchange student program since his first year, mostly because Herdium from Seiren had shown persistent interest, frequently sending letters.

Of course, those letters had dwindled recently due to the increasingly strange circumstances in Seiren.

Still, he hadn't expected Tina—an eccentric with no apparent ties to Seiren—to bring up the topic of the exchange program.

*Well, maybe that's why she can bring it up like this.*

From an elf's perspective, Tina was certainly weird, but that also meant she was flexible in her thinking.

Even in the short time he had attended her classes, Leo had noticed how she conducted lessons that other elves might consider blasphemous.

That only made her suggestion more puzzling.

"Do you have a particular reason for sending me to Seiren? I doubt I'd be welcomed there."

Tina nodded. "That's true. Not just in Seiren, but in the entire elven magical community, you aren't exactly seen in the best light."

This year, *Introduction to Stellar Magic*, published by Len, had been largely made possible thanks to Leo's unique magic, *Bible*.

On top of that, he had deciphered *the Magic of Blooming Flowers*, which had long been left unresolved. He had even obtained *Polyum* as a conquest reward from Luna, the Nebula Pioneer's, world.

Despite having no direct connection to Seiren, Leo had achieved multiple feats that were considered long-standing aspirations of the elves.

As a result, some in Seiren viewed him as a challenge to their status and harbored hostility toward him.

Tina shrugged and continued, "I'm not sending you to Seiren just to study. Frankly, unlike Lumene, I don't think there's anything worth learning in Seiren for you."

"What do you mean?"

"Seiren's ultimate goal is to produce a successor to the Nebula Pioneer, Luna. Just as our ancestor once did."

*Step— Step—*

Tina walked over to a mobile chalkboard in her office and pulled away the cloth covering it, revealing a complex magical formula.

It was none other than *the Magic of Blooming Flowers*.

"The formula you deciphered is beautiful."

Tina gazed at the formula with an oddly dreamy look in her eyes.

After admiring it for a moment, she muttered, "The elven magical community is full of stubborn fools."

A look of displeasure crossed her face.

"There are idiots who insist on denying this magic, despite the fact that you have perfectly deciphered it."

The spell Leo had unraveled—*the Magic of Blooming Flowers*—formed the very foundation of Stellar Magic, created by Luna.

It was to achieve this magic that Stellar Magic had been developed in the first place. It was no exaggeration to say that all Stellar Magic originated from it.

"I can understand why they'd refuse to accept it. It's absurd."

The magic's effect was simple—it made flowers bloom. However, the domain it touched upon was that of the *divine*.

Bringing forth flowers from nothing—creating something from nothing—was, in essence, an act of god.

The sheer complexity of the spell's construction was unparalleled, far beyond even Stellar Magic.

For a mage who valued efficiency, it was an absurdly wasteful and impractical spell.

*Well, that's exactly why it's such a Luna-like magic.*

Luna was the greatest magical genius to have ever lived, but she was also the most eccentric and unpredictable.

To those who came after, she remained a figure nearly impossible to fully understand.

"Professor Tina, it sounds like you firmly believe this magic was created by Luna."

"Of course. It would be absurd to think otherwise, given how perfectly the formula has been interpreted… and besides, I like Luna even more after seeing this spell." Tina chuckled. "There's something romantic about it, don't you think? And the fact that Luna intended to create this spell was proven when you conquered Luna's world. The stubborn fools denying it are doing nothing but insulting her legacy."

Tina grumbled before continuing, "You're the one who deciphered this magic, so it's not an exaggeration to say that you've already mastered Stellar Magic. What could Seiren possibly teach you?"

"It was just luck."

"There's no such thing as luck in magic. Especially not with a spell of this complexity." Tina smiled. "Our ancestor, Seiren Tingel himself, couldn't accomplish what you did."

She moved to the side of the office and poured herself a cup of richly brewed coffee.

After taking a sip, she spoke again, "A *Magic Conference* will be held in Seiren soon. Assistant Professor Anna will be presenting *Introduction to Stellar Magic* on behalf of Professor Len."

Leo immediately thought of Anna. Recently, she had looked utterly exhausted, completely drained from preparing for the conference.

After all, she was about to present a paper that many in Seiren—the very heart of elven magic—openly condemned as *heresy*.

According to Chloe and Chelsea, who frequently visited Anna's office to support her, she had been cursing Professor Len multiple times a day.

"You're a co-author of the paper, so you must have a deep understanding of it. I hope you can assist Assistant Professor Anna at the conference."

"And what exactly do you want me to do there?"

"What else? Smash those stubborn fools' heads open."

Kiran's eyes widened in surprise. [Like with a thick grimoire?]

"Tempting, but that'd be a problem." Tina sighed in disappointment before continuing, "Leo, you understand Stellar Magic deeply. Probably more than I do."

She looked him straight in the eyes.

"I believe the elven society needs to change. The world is undergoing a transformation, and whether you like it or not, you're at the center of it."

Tina sighed.

"If things continue as they are… Seiren—no, the entire elven race—may fall into decline. A strong shock is necessary to prevent that."

"But is it even possible for me to go there as an exchange student?" Leo asked, somewhat skeptical.

Tina grinned. "Don't worry about that. I'll handle it."

"I'll think about it."

"Sure. Oh, and if you do go to Seiren, there's one more thing I'd like to ask. It's not mandatory, so you can refuse."

"What is it?"

"My niece just started her first year there. Would you consider teaching her magic?"

"If I decide to go, I'll think about it."

"Thanks."

After finishing his conversation with Tina, Leo headed toward the party hall.

[Leo, you're going, right? You are, right? You have to go.]

Kiran clung to his side, whining persistently.

"I'm going, so stop nagging."

[Yahoo!]

Kiran cheered, darting around wildly in the air.

*He looks like a moth.*

Shaking his head at the sight, Leo sent Kiran away and stepped into the dormitory's party hall.

"Huh? It's Leo."

The moment someone spotted him and muttered, the hall fell silent.

Amidst the stillness, Leo's eyes landed on Reina, and his expression shifted slightly in surprise.

As he took a step forward, the silence eased, but the glances toward him did not disappear.

Especially the gazes from the gathered parents—they were anything but ordinary.

"Mom, you came without notice. What brings you here?"

"It's not like I'm banned from coming here, right?" Reina smiled warmly. "I watched your performance."

"And what did you think?"

"As expected of my son, you were terrifying."

Reina shook her head as if overwhelmed, and Leo chuckled.

"Leo! Lady Reina." Carl approached with a bright smile.

"Carl, who's that with you?"

"This is my sister, Kiria Thomas. She runs an alchemy shop in Moira Kingdom."

The woman, who resembled Carl, widened her eyes as she looked at Leo.

"Carl, you really were friends with Leo Plov? I thought you were just making things up."

"What kind of person do you think I am, you old auntie…?"

"Auntie? AUNTIE?! You brat—!"

"Wahhh!"

Kiria's eyes flared as she mercilessly pinched and pulled Carl's cheeks.

Afterward, she smiled at Leo and greeted him, "Nice to meet you. I'm Kiria Thomas, Carl's older sister. Thanks for being friends with my hopeless little brother."

"I'm Leo Plov. Carl has always been a great help to me."

"Wow, you're really mature. Hey, Carl, learn from your friend for once."

"I wish my son were more like Carl. Leo is too much of an old soul." Reina laughed as she listened to their conversation.

At that moment, Nella approached, accompanied by a distinguished-looking man.

"Leo, Carl. Father, let me introduce you. These are Leo Plov and Carl Thomas, my closest friends since our first year."

"I'm Leo Plov."

"Carl Thomas."

"I'm Neron Caven. My daughter seems to owe you both a great deal. It's a pleasure to meet you."

Neron greeted them politely, but his gaze soon turned to Reina.

"It's been a while, Reina."

"Indeed, Senior Neron."

Nella's eyes widened. "Father, you know Leo's mother?"

"She was a junior of mine."

"Oh…" Nella let out a small gasp.

"Your daughter takes after you. She's beautiful."

"Thank you. What was my father like during his school days? He never talks about it."

"Should I be honest?" Reina playfully asked.

"Ahem!" Neron cleared his throat. Then, looking at Reina, he said, "Reina, I'd like to talk with you for a moment."

"Leo, I'll be back after a chat with my senior."

Reina left with Neron to speak privately.

"Hey, guys!"

"There you are."

Eliana and Tade walked over with bright smiles.

"Dad, these are my closest friends since our first year—Leo Plov, Carl Thomas, and Nella Caven! Everyone, this is my father, Elvon Raden."

"Nice to meet you. My daughter speaks highly of you all."

"And this is my father, Tadam Markov. Dad, these are my friends."

"A pleasure to meet you."

Eliana's and Tade's fathers had already exchanged greetings by then.

The closest friends from their first year were now gathered together.

"What about Chelsea?"

"She's busy greeting the Lordnel family," Nella replied, smiling.

Meanwhile, the gathered parents were engaged in their own discussions.

"What do you think they're talking about?" Tade asked, curious.

Eliana smirked meaningfully. "The adults must be having their own kind of conversation. Oh, by the way, Leo, do you know what the other dorms have been calling you lately?"

"What?"

"They've started calling you the Demon King. Because you were too terrifying during the test."

Tade shook his head. "Honestly, even I was scared."

Nella smiled lazily. "You should've toned it down a little."

Carl, tilting his head, muttered, "Demon King Leo… That actually has a nice ring to it."

Eliana stroked her chin in thought.

As the group chatted, Kiria nudged Carl's side. "Wow. Zerdinger, Caven, Raden, and even the Markov family… You really hit it big."

"Heh! Do I seem impressive to you now?"

"No, you're still pathetic, but your connections are impressive."

"Ugh!" Carl bristled at his sister's remark.

Then, a crowd began to gather around Leo.

"Leo Plov, I saw your remarkable performance in the test. I am from the Derond Kingdom…"

"My son always speaks highly of you. Would you consider visiting the Western Magic Tower someday?"

"I am…"

Carl clicked his tongue as he watched. "Well, I guess this was expected."

"It really shows how much of a big deal he's become." Eliana murmured in admiration.

"May I have your attention, please!"

On the party hall's stage, Professor Sedgen spoke.

Immediately, the entire room focused on him.

"I would like to extend my gratitude to the esteemed guests who have graced us with their presence. Additionally, I wish to remind everyone that this gathering is to celebrate the second-year students who have completed their challenging exams."

Carl muttered, "Why do I have a bad feeling about this?"

"Huh? What are you talking about?" Eliana looked at him quizzically.

"Now, we will now be distributing the midterm report cards to the parents. Would all parents please gather by dormitory at the front of the stage?"

The faces of many students instantly went pale.

"Additionally, as a reminder, due to the newly implemented mentor system, voluntary withdrawals were not enforced until the end of the second-year first semester. To highlight just how much effort (or lack thereof) students have put into their studies, we will also be distributing their first-year report cards."

Eliana clutched her head in agony. "That's not fair!"

Tade's face turned deathly pale. "This school is insane!"

The parents surrounding Leo sharpened their gazes and surged toward the stage.

Watching the unfolding chaos, Carl muttered in disbelief, "This school gets more ruthless by the day."
