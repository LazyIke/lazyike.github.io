*Clang—!*

Chloe's expression shifted slightly in surprise at the unexpected figure who had stepped in. The other students were just as astonished.

The one who had blocked the shadow blade was none other than Luke. A magic circle glowed on his body, and the mana that had been suppressed by Leo's spell surged forth.

*I need to swing my sword.*

Luke swung his blade.

This battlefield was not meant for him. He was the weakest student in Lumene. A single mistake, a moment's hesitation, and he could lose his life.

*Don't falter! Stir my emotions!*

His mana amplified with the tremors of his emotions. He couldn't stand on the same stage as the others, but at the very least, he could be of help. The magic circle drawn on his body shone even brighter.

"This isn't half bad."

"Yeah, I agree."

Watching his magic in action, Leo and Chelsea gave their evaluations.

Luke had no talent for crafting spell formulas like a traditional mage, so he devised magic that suited him best. It was a simple concept—physical enhancement. 

Taking into account the nature of his mana, he constructed a spell. 

The result was magic that pushed him beyond his limits. Strength, speed, reflexes—even his dynamic vision. Everything was elevated beyond its natural boundaries.

Of course, it wasn't perfect. With such power came severe side effects. His body would overheat from exceeding its limits. 

Moreover, Luke's magic grew stronger the more his emotions flared. If he lost control, his power could spiral out of control, destroying his own body.

The day he showed his magic to Leo, Leo had asked, "Since you went and created a spell like this, that means you're prepared for the risks, right?"

"Yes. This is the only way I can become a hero."

"What makes you go this far? You want to be a hero so you can help people, right?"

"Yes."

"But you don't need to be a hero to help others."

"If I become a hero, I can help even more people. I want to make the world a better place. A world where people can be a little happier than they are now."

"What drives you to the extreme?"

"The heroes in fairy tales always looked happy when they saved people. I admired them, and I wanted to be like that."

"Fairy tales are just stories."

"I know. But there were also people who saved the world without needing a reason. Of course, I won't ever be like the Great Heroes." Luke smiled faintly. "But if I can help make the world they left behind just a little bit better before passing it on to the next generation, then I think that would be truly meaningful."

He was right. Lysinas, Luna, Aaron, and Dweno—none of them saved the world for a reward. They simply wanted to protect the world they loved. 

Luke was no different.

Leo smiled. "Alright. If that's what you truly want, then every time you use that magic, think about what you want to achieve. Imagine the person you want to become. If you do that, then that magic will… bring you one step closer to the ideal you're striving for."

*Unique Magic, Transcendence.*

*Whoosh—!*

Luke's sword moved with incredible speed.

*Clang—! Clang—! Clang—!*

A silver streak intercepted the shadow blades. Everyone was astonished by the weakest first-year's unexpected display.

Aina's eyes widened as she watched Luke. For a brief moment, Luke's sword had surpassed her own.

"Impressive." Chloe smiled. Her spell was now complete.

"Fimbulvetr!"

As she unleashed her unique magic, an absolute frost enveloped the darkness.

*Crackle—!*

The shadows were frozen solid.

*Snap! Crack! Crackle—!*

The frozen darkness shattered and crumbled.

*Whoosh—!*

The main body of the darkness sank into the ground and vanished.

Darian spat out a string of curses. "Damn it! Damn it! They're just a bunch of brats!"

While the Shadow Lord was away, he had infiltrated the underground labyrinth of the Casino of Shadows and successfully seized the power within. He had obtained overwhelming dragonkin mana—only to discover it was tainted with darkness. 

That fact enraged him, but when he realized this power belonged to Lysinas, he felt ecstasy instead. He had inherited the power of the Wise Queen.

Then came the report of an incident in Dovela. He had rushed here without fully stabilizing Lysinas's rampaging mana, but it didn't matter. 

He had planned to take his time subjugating this power after wiping out the bratty upstarts. And once he used this strength to eliminate the demons of Tartaros—his so-called "allies"—he would officially claim the title of Great Hero's successor.

For years, the world had revolved around Lumene and the hero academies. But now, he would shift that balance in his favor.

That had been his ambition.

Yet, he had been beaten by mere second-years.

*Only because I couldn't control the power properly!* 

Darian screamed internally.

It was a humiliation beyond words. A graduate of Lumene, a man who had spent years honing his strength—yet he had failed to overpower mere first- and second-years. Even after obtaining Lysinas's power. And still, he lost.

*No! I didn't lose! This was a tactical retreat!*

He refused to accept it.

*Lumene is wrong! This whole system is wrong! How could brats raised under such nonsense ever surpass me?!*

He denied the reality before him.

*That's right! If only I can fully control this power...*

"Look at you, running away."

*Flinch—!*

Darian, who had been moving through the alleyways of Dovela, froze at the voice ahead.

*Step— Step—*

From around the corner, Leo emerged.

Darian curled his lips into a sneer. "Well, well. If it isn't the youngest student council president in Lumene's history. Or should I say... not a student at all?"

Disgust flickered in Darian's eyes. "You're just a filthy Shadow playing hero."

Leo smirked. "At least I'm not a pathetic traitor licking Tartaros's boots."

"Hah. I'm merely using those foolish demons to my advantage."

Leo let out a tired sigh. "That kind of excuse is getting old."

"You talk as if you've heard it before."

"I have. So many times, in fact, that I've been sick of it for five thousand years."

"I don't know what nonsense you're spouting, but... I am different." Darian's eyes gleamed. "I was meant to be a hero! I should have graduated from Lumene, conquered countless Hero Worlds, and had my name inscribed in the Hero Record!" 

His voice rose in fury. "But Lumene never even gave me the chance!"

"Lumene allows even graduates to challenge Hero Records."

"I have no interest in the records of third-rate heroes! I want the records of the greatest heroes in history!"

Leo narrowed his eyes. "You really don't know your place."

"What?"

"Just because you inherit a hero's power doesn't mean you automatically become as strong as them."

*Step— Step—*

Leo walked toward Darian. "Just because you inherit a Great Hero's strength doesn't mean you are one. That's basic knowledge, isn't it?"

A murderous aura seeped from Leo's body, and his gaze turned ice-cold. 

"You're just someone who failed to surpass his limits and blamed everyone else for it—a dropout. Who the hell do you think you are to insult the heroes who achieved feats worthy of the gods' recognition?"

"Shut up! Even a filthy Shadow like you had the privilege of conquering the greatest Hero Worlds!" Darian snarled. "What kind of joke is it that you're the youngest student council president? That you're some great hero? You just got lucky and stumbled into the worlds of the Great Heroes!"

*Whoosh—!*

Dark blades erupted from Darian's body. It was the unique magic of the black dragon Lysinas had sealed away—an ability so savage and cruel that it had never been passed down. 

Even Rodia, upon witnessing it, had chosen to bury it forever.

*Slash—!*

The dark blade pierced through Leo's body.

Darian smirked. "You should have known your place. Maybe then you would've lived a little longer."

"You're right."

"...!" Darian's eyes widened in shock.

Leo, impaled by the dark blade, continued walking toward him. "If I had, then I wouldn't have had to go through this hassle."

*Slither—*

The dark blade seeped into Leo's body.

Darian's face twisted in disbelief. "H-How?! How did you absorb it?!"

*Whoosh—!*

The blades surged toward Leo again.

*Slash! Slash! Slash!*

They stabbed him from all directions, yet not a single scratch appeared on Leo's body.

*Slither—*

The magic was simply absorbed into him.

"What kind of trick is this?!"

"Lysinas's power can't harm me."

Lysinas's power belonged to Lysinas. And in her absence, that power belonged to the one who had accepted everything she had left behind—Leo.

Trying to kill Leo with Lysinas's power was no different than trying to kill him with his own strength.

"So? Got anything else?" he taunted.

"Ugh...!" Darian instinctively tried to summon more mana.

*Slash—! Splatter—!*

"Aaaaaghhh!"

The dark blades he had unleashed severed his own wrist. His hand fell to the ground, blood spraying from the stump.

Screaming in agony, Darian clutched his wrist and staggered back, but when he saw Leo approaching, he turned and ran.

*If I stay here, I'll be killed!*

That was the only thought in his head as he tried to flee.

*Crunch—!*

"Ack!"

Lysinas's power—the very strength he thought he had stolen—shattered his leg.

*Thud—!*

He collapsed, writhing in pain, as Leo slowly walked up to him.

*Swish—!*

Leo exerted his will over Lysinas's magic within Darian's body.

Terror filled Darian's eyes as he was forced to his feet against his will. "P-Please, spare me!" 

Leo looked at him impassively. "Stop struggling and just die."

"I-I'm your senior! A graduate of the hero academy! You think you can just murder your senior like this?! And still call yourself a hero candidate?!" Darian shrieked in desperation.

Leo burst into laughter. "Sorry, but..." 

He flicked his fingers, and the darkness binding Darian began to constrict.

"You just called me a Shadow, didn't you?"

"Mmph! Mmmph!"

*Crunch—! Crack—!*

The shadows clamped over Darian's mouth, squeezing him even tighter.

"A Shadow's job is to eliminate traitors." Leo turned away, smiling faintly. "And I've never had a senior like you."

"Mmmph!"

*Splatter—!*

A grotesque sound echoed through the alley.

*Drip— Drip—*

Blood, bones, and flesh rained onto the ground as the power Darian had foolishly thought he could wield was swallowed into Leo's shadows.

Leo leapt high into the air, overlooking all of Dovela. He saw hero candidates standing their ground, refusing to retreat in the face of danger. 

Watching them, he smiled.

*These kids are the future of the world.*

The legacy Lysinas had left behind still shone in this world.

*So don't worry too much, Lysinas.*
