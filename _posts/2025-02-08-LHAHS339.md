That afternoon, inside the Seiren lower-class classroom, Leo was preparing for the next lesson.

Like Lumene, Seiren didn't only offer specialized courses. There were various general education classes as well. Among them, the most important was the combat magic class.

At Lumene, it was known as combat studies. The difference was that Seiren, true to its focus on Stellar Magic, emphasized combat that relied heavily on it.

The other lower-class students were preparing eagerly. Even those who usually avoided attending had shown up without exception. Everyone was brimming with enthusiasm.

*If someone saw them like this, they'd seem like honor students.*

Leo rested his chin on his hand, lost in thought.

*Now, the question is, how do I go about fixing Seiren?*

If he were an actual Seiren student, he could take his time and gradually change things step by step. But he was only an outsider.

*Asking Mel for help has its limits.*

It was true that the Dragon Lord held great influence over the hero academies, but there were limits to how much they could interfere in operations.

*The best way would be to publicly expose how flawed Seiren's system is.*

Leo was still deep in thought when...

*Clatter—*

The classroom door swung open, and Laura hurriedly entered.

"Everyone! Get ready to head out!"

At her sudden announcement, the lower-class students blinked in surprise.

"Today, we're having a combat magic practical lesson!"

"Really?"

"We're actually using the combat training grounds?"

Their eyes widened.

"Yes! We finally got permission today!"

"Wow!"

"We're finally doing practical training!"

Cheers erupted throughout the room.

Leo, watching the excited reactions, looked puzzled.

"Why are they so worked up?"

"Lyle, you don't know?" Angel, seated next to him, gave a bitter smile. "Our lower class has never had a single practical combat lesson."

"You've only studied theory all this time?"

"Yeah. That's why this is amazing! We finally get to test the Stellar Magic we've been learning! You know better than anyone—there's only so much theory can do!"

Practical training was essential for studying and researching magic. No matter how well someone memorized complex magic formulas or developed new techniques, there was no way to know if they were viable in real combat without testing them.

And just like at Lumene, performing magic experiments—especially offensive magic—outside of designated school grounds was strictly prohibited. It was simply too dangerous.

*Every time I dig deeper, I find more discrimination.*

Leo sighed and stood up.

With excitement written all over their faces, the lower-class students rushed toward the training grounds.

Braving the frigid weather, they arrived at the outdoor training grounds.

The Stellar Magic training grounds were a collection of everything magic-related. Inside, it was as warm as a spring day, unaffected by the cold outside. There were enchanted scarecrows for testing attack spells and golems to assist with battle practice. Everything needed for magical combat training was there.

*The facilities seem better than Lumene's.*

Leo stroked his chin. The system wasn't just designed for magic training—it was useful for knights and summoners as well. As expected of the hero academy with the most advanced magic development.

The lower-class students were still admiring the training grounds when…

"You've arrived, lower class."

"Mr. Autren?"

Laura turned in surprise. She looked at Autren, the homeroom teacher of Seiren's first-year advanced class 1.

"When I inquired at the faculty office, I was told our class had been granted permission to use the grounds. Why is the advanced class here?"

Laura asked, clearly bewildered.

Autren chuckled.

"Ah, I suppose the faculty didn't inform you? These training grounds were originally scheduled for our advanced class 1 all afternoon. However, I took pity on your lower-class students and *graciously* allowed a joint session. You should be grateful, lower-class students."

Laura's face hardened.

"Such generosity toward our class… I don't know what to say. But our presence will surely interfere with your students' lesson. Perhaps it would be best if we use the grounds another time…"

"What? Miss Laura! But this is a rare opportunity!"

"Can't we train together?"

The lower-class students looked at Laura, their voices laced with desperation. They were starved for proper lessons. They didn't want to give up this long-awaited chance at practical training.

"Miss Laura, will you really just walk away when your students are so eager?"

Laura clenched her teeth.

*His intentions are too obvious.*

Someone as prideful as Autren wouldn't offer kindness to the lower class.

There was only one reason for this—he wanted to show them the *overwhelming* gap between them and the advanced class.

"Lower-class students, let's do it this way."

Autren spread his arms and smiled.

"For today's lesson, your class and the advanced class will have a sparring session."

The lower-class students froze in shock.

"If you win, that means you're talented enough to belong in the advanced class. I will personally ensure that you are immediately transferred."

At the offer, their eyes widened.

But soon, their hands curled into fists.

They had been placed in the lower class due to their lack of Stellar Magic proficiency, but many of them refused to accept that label.

Some believed that aside from Stellar Magic, they surpassed the advanced students in overall ability.

Angel clenched her fists tightly. "The advanced class…"

"And since this is a combat magic lesson, there is only one rule. The duel must be fought using *only* Stellar Magic!"

At Autren's declaration, the lower-class students hesitated.

"O-Only Stellar Magic?"

"That means… it's strictly a magic duel?"

"Of course."

"Mr. Autren! My specialty is summoning!"

One of the lower-class summoning students, Bells, raised his hand. He was one of the leading summoning students in the lower class and highly skilled.

Autren's face turned cold. "And what of it?"

"Huh?"

"If you are a proud student of Seiren, then it is only natural that Stellar Magic takes priority over summoning."

"T-That's…"

"If you prioritize summoning over Stellar Magic, do you even have a place at Seiren?"

"If you are truly a proud student of Seiren, then it should be obvious that Stellar Magic is far more important than summoning, shouldn't it?"

"T-That's..."

"If you prioritize summoning over Stellar Magic, do you even have a reason to be at Seiren?"

At Autren's blatantly Stellar Magic-centric remarks, Bells fell silent.

"And if you are so confident in your summoning skills..." Autren smirked and pointed at a student. "I will grant you the opportunity to test your abilities against the first-year top student, Lea Tingel."

Bells' mouth snapped shut. Lea Tingel. A direct descendant of the Tingel family and the student who had successfully communicated with the Fairy King just yesterday. Both in magic and summoning, she was considered one of the best.

As Bells remained speechless, Autren let out a derisive chuckle.

At that moment, Angel spoke. "Mr. Autren, if this is a duel, then does that mean we are free to fight Lea with everything we have?"

Autren's expression stiffened at Angel's defiant gaze.

"How insolent. Are you, a mere student, challenging a teacher's authority? Very well. I will permit the duel. However, as the price for challenging my authority, if you lose, you will be immediately expelled. Do you still wish to proceed?"

Angel flinched. Lea's face tensed in alarm.

Angel's clenched fists trembled at her sides before she lowered her head. "I apologize. I spoke out of turn."

"Hmph. Then, before we assign the dueling pairs..." Autren smirked. "I will personally teach you lower-class students what real combat magic is. You there, the white-haired lower-class student."

Autren pointed directly at Leo.

"Me?"

Leo raised a finger to himself, and Autren's smirk deepened.

"Yes. You shall represent the lower class as an example. Step forward."

Autren strode to the center of the dueling arena.

Watching him, Leo let out a soft chuckle.

"A duel using purely Stellar Magic?"

"Correct."

"Are all other forms of magic strictly prohibited?"

"Of course."

*Then you're going to regret this.*

{sep}

*I get to witness Senior Plov's Stellar Magic!*

Lea clasped her hands together, eyes shining with anticipation.

"Why is Mr. Autren even bothering to duel a lower-class reject? It's a complete waste of time."

One of the advanced class 1 students scowled in irritation.

Lea's eyes flared. *Who the hell is he calling a reject?*

"Don't call your fellow classmates rejects."

At that moment, Elric adjusted his horn-rimmed glasses and spoke up.

The student who had been mocking Leo smirked. "Why? Feeling sympathy because you're from a no-name family too?"

Elric's gaze turned ice-cold. "You think being ranked second makes you something special? Let's see if you can hold onto that rank after midterms..."

*Thud!*

The mocking student's body bent backward at an unnatural angle.

Lea had landed a precise dropkick to his gut.

With an apologetic look, she said, "Oh my, I'm sorry. I meant to stomp on a bug."

"Y-Yeah... that... happens... Kgh!"

"I think he needs to be sent to the infirmary."

Laura sighed as she watched the boy groaning in pain.

The other advanced class 1 students glanced at Lea, who was smiling innocently, and seemed to believe she had, in fact, been stepping on a bug.

"But... are there even bugs in the training hall?"

"There could be."

While the small commotion unfolded, Autren snapped his fingers in the center of the dueling arena.

*Flash!*

Suddenly, over a hundred identical figures of Autren appeared.

Stellar Magic: Mirage.

One of the most basic Stellar Magic techniques, said to be a favorite of the Nebula Pioneer.

Gasps of awe erupted from the watching students.

"As expected, a teacher's level is completely different, even with a basic spell."

"A hundred clones... that's insane."

*Leo Plov... ever since last year, you've been challenging Seiren's authority.*

Autren's gaze sharpened as he locked eyes with Leo. He already knew Leo's true identity.

This class wasn't just about showing the lower-class students the overwhelming gap between them and the advanced students. More than anything, Autren wanted to personally crush Leo.

*Just because you know a little Stellar Magic, you act as if you've mastered it. I'll show you reality.*

Leo met Autren's gaze, his face unreadable.

"How crude."

His voice was quiet, but it reached Autren's ears clearly.

*What nonsense is he spouting...?*

Grinding his teeth, Autren's anger flared.

Then their eyes met.

And for a moment, Autren stiffened.

*No way... did he already figure out which one is the real me?!*

His face twisted in shock.

Raising his hand, Leo activated a spell.

*Hum—!*

A magic circle formed in the air.

*In a duel using only Stellar Magic, there is no one in the world who can defeat me except for one person.*

Leo smiled, recalling a friend.

Even if his current power was nowhere near his peak as a Great Hero, that fact hadn't changed.

In an instant, he analyzed Autren's spell.

*A fake can never surpass the original.*

*Flash!*

Autren's spell collapsed.

His mirage clones vanished without a trace.

His face turned pale with shock.

"What... what did you do?!"

"If you perfectly analyze a magic formula, dispelling it is simple."

"It's impossible to completely analyze someone else's spell that fast...!"

"It's only impossible for you."

Leo walked toward Autren.

*Hum—!*

In the blink of an eye, a hundred Leos materialized.

The exact same mirage spell.

The crowd gaped in disbelief.

"What do you think of my Stellar Magic, teacher?"

Autren's eyes flickered as he saw the intricate structure of Leo's magic.

"Since you seem so skilled, why don't you evaluate it for me?"
