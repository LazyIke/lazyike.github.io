At the center of Lumene, in front of the Tower of Heroes, a grand party was currently taking place.

Since it was an event welcoming external guests visiting Lumene, all students were required to attend without exception. Of course, with renowned heroes and influential figures who shaped the world gathering in one place, most students had no complaints about participating.

The distinguished guests from various regions showed great interest in the most promising students of Lumene. And as expected, the ones who garnered the most attention were the second-year students, often called Lumene's golden generation.

"Oh, so you must be Chloe Mueller. Miss Mueller, your thesis is currently drawing great attention in the field of magic."

"Prince Duran. The central kingdoms of the continent have high expectations for you!"

"So you're Walden? You certainly seem to have the makings of someone worthy of a contract with a Great Spirit."

Watching the scene, Chelsea grinned. "Everyone's really popular, huh~"

"And you guys aren't?" Carl, who was happily enjoying the feast with a plate full of buffet food, teased.

"We're from the Lordren Empire," Chelsea replied.

"Well, yeah. No matter how promising you guys are, no one's going to try and recruit someone from the Lordren Empire. But Senior, you're not fighting today?" Carl tilted his head as he looked at Niel and Marcel.

The relationship between Celia and Chelsea was infamous among the second-years. But there was an even greater rivalry—Niel and Marcel, the heirs of the vassal houses serving those two families. Despite being seniors and juniors with a one-year gap, every time they met, sparks flew, yet today, they were unusually quiet.

"Even Chelsea and Celia are being tame today."

Celia swept her hair back. "Do you think I growl at Chelsea every time I see her, regardless of time and place?"

"Yeah," Carl answered without hesitation.

Celia's face went blank.

Sensing danger, Carl quickly changed the subject. "Anyway, is there a reason for you guys being cooperative today?"

Chelsea answered, "To keep the pests away."

"Pests? Ahh." Carl, who had tilted his head at Chelsea's words, soon nodded in understanding.

His gaze shifted to Leo, who was sitting alone with a relaxed expression.

"Leo isn't from the Lordren Empire, right?"

Leo's family was the Plov Family, and his official affiliation was with the Kingdom of Dellad. Although he was acknowledged as a direct descendant of Zerdinger, it was still through his maternal lineage. 

That meant countless factions had their eyes on Leo.

The youngest student council president in Lumene Academy's history. An all-class hero like the Hero of the Beginning. And even at such a young age, he had already achieved remarkable feats.

For any influential figure, Leo was an incredibly tempting prospect. Even now, many were glancing at him eagerly, clearly wanting to approach. 

However, with Celia and Chelsea glaring at them, no one dared to come close. No matter how high their status, no one would be reckless enough to make a move on Leo in front of direct descendants of Zerdinger and Lewellin.

*A dedicated guard detail, huh.*

Carl accepted the situation as he continued to enjoy his meal.

*Well, it sure makes things easier.*

Leo smirked slightly and let the two be. He had thought this party would be exhausting, but now he realized there was no need to worry.

*I suppose my standing in this era is no longer low.*

Spending so much time in Lumene, he had become numb to the way outsiders viewed him. But through this event, he came to a clear realization.

Leo's existence was now deeply engraved into the world. Everyone knew of Leo. Everyone praised his achievements.

As he thought this, a certain figure came to mind.

*The Lich King Hell Kaiser.*

The supreme commander of Tartaros. A grand demon with both the power and charisma fitting of such a title.

*His most terrifying trait is his insight.*

In the early days of the Age of Calamity, it was the Lich King's leadership that allowed Tartaros to crush countless powerful nations and heroes, expanding its territory at an unprecedented scale.

*Even after we gained enough power to hunt down legion commanders, he still managed to put us in danger time and time again.*

That was how fearsome the Lich King Hell Kaiser was.

Even after the Age of Calamity ended, even as the world was rebuilt and the Age of Heroes began, Tartaros had never been completely destroyed. And it was all because of the Lich King.

*I wonder what the Lich King thinks of me right now.*

Since Leo had entered Lumene, countless incidents had occurred. Each and every one of them had shaken the world.

From the Lich King's perspective, it must have been baffling. An unknown young human had suddenly appeared and was effortlessly turning the impossible into reality.

The Lich King had encountered something similar 5,000 years ago.

*Lysinas and I, along with Luna, Aaron, and Dweno.*

The Great Heroes who had prevented the world's seemingly inevitable destruction and ultimately saved it.

To the world, they had been a miraculous beacon of hope.

To the Lich King, they had been a disaster.

*If he truly has that level of insight...*

Leo narrowed his eyes.

*Then he may have already begun to suspect the truth about me.*

Leo clenched and unclenched his hand.

*From now on, I should move under the assumption that he knows who I am.*

Leo's gaze sharpened.

*A grudge spanning 5,000 years. It's time to bring it to an end.*

"Senior Plov!"

With her hands clasped together, Lea let out a high-pitched squeal and tried to charge toward Leo—only to be stopped when Lunia grabbed her by the nape of her neck, holding her back while clutching her forehead.

"Lea, you're Seiren's first-year top student, remember? You're the face of our school. This is an event where countless heroes and influential figures from around the world have gathered. Shouldn't you refrain from embarrassing yourself and disgracing our academy?" Lunia scolded.

Lea squinted at her. "Senior Lunia, don't you feel even a little guilty lecturing me about Seiren's honor?"

Lunia had long since thrown away any pretense of modesty and tossed it into the trash. That didn't mean she lost her temper at every little thing, though.

"I still know when to pick my moments."

"Do you, really?"

At the blatant disbelief in her junior's voice, Lunia, without hesitation, started choking Lea.

*Squeeze—!*

"Fine. I won't pick my moments anymore, just like you want."

"Keuk! I-I surrender! I surrender!"

"Watch your tone."

"I-I surrender, ma'am!"

Lea flailed as she tapped on Lunia's arm.

"Hmph! You really have a junior who's just like you!"

A smug voice suddenly rang out. Standing there, arms crossed, was Aru, dressed neatly in Azonia's uniform.

"Ohhh! Lunia! Aru! How have you been?" Drianna, wearing Damien's uniform, greeted them cheerfully. 

Seeing them, Lea's eyes widened.

Earlier this year, these three had conquered Dweno's World and were hailed as the next-generation hero candidates.

*The pressure they give off is no joke.*

Shaking off the lighthearted mood, Lea tensed up as she looked at the three. 

Just then,Lunia remarked, "You still haven't dropped that weird speech pattern?"

Drianna crossed her arms. "I'm always striving to act like the great Dweno!"

"You sound nothing like him, though," Aru coldly pointed out, but Drianna ignored her.

"Anyway, since we've run into each other, I have a request," Drianna spoke with a serious expression.

Lea tensed slightly. A request from one of the next-generation hero candidates?

*Could it be about gathering materials for some incredible weapon? Or maybe there's a major issue within Damien?*

Lea's eyes darted around as she tried to guess...

"If you're going to ask me to pose nude for you again, I refuse, you perverted dwarf," Aru snapped.

Lea couldn't believe her ears.

"It's all for the sake of art."

"Didn't Dweno tell you to quit art?" Lunia commented coldly.

"What matters is a heart that never gives up. Dweno surely would have said the same."

"If Dweno were here, he'd beg you to give up art."

"He'd tell you outright that it's okay to quit."

Despite Aru and Lunia's brutal words, Drianna didn't flinch. Then, spotting Lea, she asked, "Oh, what a beautiful young lady. Would you like to be a nude model?"

"No." Lea, answering flatly, turned to Lunia with a serious expression. "The conversation is too high-level for me to understand, isn't it?"

"No, her words are just too crude to understand," Lunia sighed.

As the three students, each hailed as the future of their respective races, exchanged ridiculous dialogue...

"Hello, everyone."

Someone called out. The four of them turned their heads in surprise. Standing there was none other than the Dragon Queen, Melina.

"I-It's an honor to meet you, your majesty." Lunia quickly bowed in greeting. 

From beneath her veil, Melina let out a soft chuckle. "There's no need to be so tense." Smiling warmly, she then looked at Lea. "Miss Lea Tingel."

"Y-yes!"

"Why don't you spend some time talking with Lumene's first-years? I'm sure it will be of great help to you."

"Understood!"

Lea answered with military precision and stepped back. She wanted to keep talking, but she couldn't possibly go against the words of the Dragon Queen.

*Still, listening in from a distance should be fine, right?*

Overcome with curiosity, Lea sneaked a glance at the four.

"Huh?" She let out a bewildered sound.

The four of them, who had been standing there just a moment ago, were gone.

*What?*

She looked around frantically. Even though they were a highly noticeable group, she couldn't see them anywhere.

*Now that I think about it, no one made a fuss when the Dragon Queen appeared.*

Normally, just having the Dragon Queen show up in the middle of a party like this should have caused a massive commotion. Yet, the atmosphere of the banquet remained unchanged.

*Could it be a perception-dampening spell? Wow, incredible. I didn't even notice it.*

In awe of the remarkably delicate and subtle magic, Lea couldn't help but be impressed.

Facing Melina, the three students stiffened and stood at attention. 

Seeing them, Melina chuckled, "No need to be so nervous. I just wanted to have a conversation with you all."

"I-It's an honor," Lunia answered, her voice trembling.

"But why us...?" Aru asked with a slightly puzzled expression.

Melina smiled. "Because you are hero candidates chosen by this era."

Drianna's eyes widened. "Does this mean you have chosen us, your majesty?"

Throughout history, dragons had always chosen the heroes destined to shape an era. Among them, the hero chosen by the Dragon Queen was special.

That was why Melina's words, that they were hero candidates chosen by this era, were enough to shock the three of them. 

Watching their reactions, Melina smiled. "Rather than me choosing you... it was *that person* who did."

"That person?"

Hearing her respectful tone, the three of them were struck with disbelief.

The Dragon Queen. The ruler of Dragonia and queen of all dragons. In some ways, the highest-ranked being in the world.

And yet, she was referring to someone else with honorifics?

*Who in the world could it be?*

As they remained stunned, Melina glanced toward *that person*—Leo.

And for a brief moment, she froze.

*What is that?*

Melina sensed an unfamiliar force emanating from Leo. A faint yet distinct power.

*I've felt this somewhere before...*

Tilting her head slightly, she soon realized the nature of the energy Leo was exuding.

*It's similar to the power of the Hero Record.*
