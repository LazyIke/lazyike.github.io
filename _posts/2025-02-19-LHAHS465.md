The Nebula Pioneer, the Fairy Knight, and the Comet Mage were the three greatest heroes in elven history.

Of them, Velkia Ersar was recognized as the hero who led the reconstruction of the world and the revival of her race at the end of the Age of Calamity.

*But in this era, even her recognition is overshadowed by Seiren.*

Leo rested his chin on his hand as he looked at the textbook.

*It's inevitable. Not much of Velkia's Hero Record remains, and while she's classified as a figure from the Age of Heroes, to be precise, she was from the same era as us.*

Five thousand years had passed. Though the stories of Velkia had been passed down through her descendants in the Ersar Family, the accounts were ancient. On top of that, her Hero Record had been damaged 3,000 years ago during the sealing of Erebos' fragment.

Compared to Seiren, who had once again saved the world from Erebos, it was natural that Velkia's renown had faded.

Leo had also searched for records of his disciple, Velkia. Yet, within the countless documents, he had found no detailed accounts of her true strength.

*However, Velkia's potential for growth was boundless even back then. She wouldn't have stopped training.*

Thinking of his disciple, Leo let out a bitter smile.

He had few regrets about his past life. He had lived through an era that had reached the brink of the world's destruction, but he had companions who were like family, and in the end, they had saved the world. Though they had left it in an imperfect state, he had gained another chance in this new life to put an end to the Primordial Evil.

The deaths of his friends were tragic, but not a single one of them had regretted their own death. Not one had shed tears for the future they would never see or for what they could not achieve.

That was why Leo mourned their passing but did not pity them.

Kyle's life had been no different. A life filled with loss and suffering. Still, having achieved something meaningful, he had no room for regret.

No, if there was one lingering regret... it was that he had not been able to witness the full growth of his disciples.

Compared to Velkia, Bihar's life had been particularly unfortunate.

*She could have lived in the light, yet she chose to remain in the shadows.*

Though she had likely chosen that path to protect the world left behind by the Great Heroes, Leo couldn't help but feel bitter. 

The same was true for Velkia. Too much time had passed, and he had no way of knowing what became of his other disciple after his own death.

Velkia and Lumene. The reason he found it difficult to determine who was superior was exactly that.

Leo had no way of knowing how much Velkia had grown. No way of knowing the heights she had reached. Nevertheless...

*Both Luna and Aaron acknowledged her talent. Her swordsmanship sense was extraordinary. She must have become far stronger than the Velkia I remember.*

Velkia had not learned Luna's Stellar Magic, but using the magical knowledge imparted by her mentor, she had established a solid foundation for her own magical system. She had not fully inherited Aaron's aura skills, but with the techniques he had taught her, she developed her own.

*Now that I think about it, it really is a shame.*

Leo closed his eyes and let out a deep sigh.

*What kind of person did Velkia grow into?*

As Leo thought of Velkia, discussions among the students grew more heated. The majority leaned toward supporting the Twilight Knight, whom they were far more familiar with.

Seeing this, Mel said, "As you all know, Lumene was the one who, following the Great Heroes, saved the world once again."

*Step, step.*

"On the other hand, Velkia is mostly known for rebuilding the world."

The students nodded.

"But do you think rebuilding the world was an easy task?"

"Well, it must have been difficult."

"Of course, it wouldn't have been easy."

"But wasn't it an era where Erebos was already gone?"

At the students' response, Mel nodded. "That's true, but just because Erebos was gone, does that mean the world immediately found peace?"

"That..."

As the students hesitated, Mel wrote a term on the board: The Great War.

"The Great War."

The war that Tartaros waged in an attempt to fulfill Erebos' will after he had been vanquished.

"The academic world doesn't place much emphasis on this war. After all, it happened right after Erebos was defeated, and without Erebos, Tartaros suffered a catastrophic blow."

The students nodded at Mel's words.

"However, Tartaros' power at the time was still formidable. Even without divine authority, a legion commander was still a legion commander. At that time, Tartaros' forces were stronger than ever. According to records, in the entire 5,000-year history of the Age of Heroes, Tartaros was at its strongest during that period."

The war to decide the world's fate did not end with Erebos' defeat.

"According to records, the Great War lasted for ten years, and the one who led that war to victory was Velkia."

A student raised a hand. "Wasn't Godthrone able to fend off Tartaros' attacks even when Erebos was still around?"

"Yes, but just as Tartaros had lost Erebos, the world had also lost the Great Heroes."

The students fell silent.

Mel smiled gently. "The most important point in today's lesson isn't whether early heroes or later heroes were greater, or whether Lumene was stronger than Velkia. What I want you all to take away from this class is that the heroes of the early Age of Heroes were just as great and powerful as the later ones."

*Ding-dong-dang-dong.*

Right on cue, the bell rang, signaling the end of the lesson.

Mel closed her books and smiled. "For the next class, please write a report on the heroic achievements of early heroes and the lessons we can learn from them."

Groans erupted throughout the room. Finding material on early heroes was not easy.

Eliana scratched her head in frustration. "Ugh! This is going to be a tough assignment."

"But it's an important topic. At the last summit, the existence of Hero Records from the Age of Calamity was officially confirmed, remember?"

"That's right. Previously undiscovered Hero Records are being found now. We might even have to explore them someday. It's good to be prepared."

Chen Xia smiled before turning to look at Leo. "Sir Leo, which hero are you planning to write your report on?"

"The Fairy Knight Velkia," Leo replied, planning to take it easy by writing about his own disciple.

"Oh? Then as a swordswoman, should I write about Velkia too..."

"I'm not letting you see my homework."

"That's unfair!" Eliana, who had been stroking her chin, flared up at Leo's words.

"Guys! There's news!"

At that moment, Carl, who had been chatting with a staff member cleaning the school, widened his eyes and ran over to where Leo was.

"What is it?" Eliana's eyes gleamed as Carl spoke.

"A request board has been set up in the second-year dormitory's communal garden!"

At those words, the nearby students flinched. The request board was undoubtedly the same request system Sedgen had announced that morning for the second-semester combat evaluation scores.

As students began rushing over...

*Swish! Smack!*

"Gack!"

A flying whip coiled around Carl's neck.

Eliza said coldly, "And why, exactly, are you sharing such vital information with students from other dorms first, Carl Thomas?"

"What does it matter? It's better if everyone knows..."

"Have you forgotten that you belong to Noble?"

Eliana crossed her arms with a smug smirk. "You didn't know? Carl is the spy we planted. Anyway, guys! We need to hurry too, or all the good requests will be taken!"

With that, Eliana dashed off.

"Hey! If I'm your spy, at least take care of me!"

"You're a Noble student!"

Carl gave a sorrowful smile as he watched Eliana heartlessly shout back at him.

"What a truly touching display of friendship," Eliza scoffed.

Carl replied, "At least Leo, Chloe, and Chelsea stayed with me. You guys are all I have!"

"We only stayed because we don't really care what requests we take," Chelsea replied bluntly.

Carl snickered. "Then I guess you won't need these?" he said, pulling out a few sheets of paper from his coat.

Chloe's eyes widened. "Aren't those request forms?"

"Of course. I asked the staff to reserve the best ones for me when the board was set up. Reputation matters, you know?" Carl stroked his chin, looking rather pleased with himself.

"Honestly, I figured Carl wouldn't just give away valuable information for free," Chen Xia smiled.

"Then why didn't you give Eliana a heads-up?" Chelsea asked.

"It's revenge for abandoning me." Grinning, Carl handed out the request forms. "By the way, Leo, just so you know, I only took a few request sheets. That's not against the rules, right? As long as I put them back, there's no issue."

"I'm not turning you in," Leo chuckled.

Carl sighed in relief.

"There really are a lot of good ones here."

Among the A-rank requests, many had high rewards, were relatively easy, or offered substantial points.

"Carl, which request are you taking?"

"The Northern Magic Tower needs an alchemy assistant. Chloe, you know the tower master's daughter, right?"

"Yeah. Anya is a half-elf, but she's a good person."

"Oh my, alchemy? The request says they need three assistants. Do you think I could join as well?" Chen Xia asked, interested.

Listening to their conversation, Leo recalled Anya Becks.

*Anya? That girl with the crazy eyes?*

Officially, she was the daughter of the Northern Magic Tower Master, but in reality, she was a Shadow. Chen Xia, being aware of this fact, was naturally intrigued.

"Sir Leo, what do you think about this request?"

"I already have something else in mind."

"Oh? That's a shame," Chen Xia said disappointedly.

"Then maybe I should go," Chloe said.

Chelsea tilted her head. "What about you, Leo? Were you assigned a request?" she asked.

Leo narrowed his eyes. "No, but there's one that's been bothering me."

{sep}

A week later, the Lumene warp gate was crowded with second-year students. From today, they would be deployed outside the school for their request assignments.

Leo's destination was the remote northeastern region of the continent. The request he had accepted was none other than the [Investigation of Hero's Tomb Robberies] request he had seen at the central plaza.

*The northeastern region consists of several small kingdoms vying for power, doesn't it?*

It was currently the most unstable and lawless area on the continent.

*The client is a viscount of the Carnel Kingdom.*

As Leo reviewed the details of the request...

*Huh? There's another student assigned to this request besides me?*

Given the mystery surrounding it, he had assumed no one else would take it. That meant whoever had chosen this request was quite the eccentric.

*Did someone sign up because I took it?*

Considering how female students had been paying excessive attention to him lately, he couldn't rule out the possibility. After all, it was the kind of request that only a true oddball would take.

Suddenly, a familiar voice called out to him cheerfully, "Oh? Could it be that you're the one who took the [Investigation of Hero's Tomb Robberies] request, Leo?"

Turning his head, Leo saw a female student approaching him with confident strides. It was the third-year representative, Lily Luce.

"Senior Lily, are you my partner for this?" he asked.

"So it is you, Leo! I never expected you to be interested in mysteries!" Lily beamed as she enthusiastically grabbed and shook Leo's hand.

"Senior, if I may ask… Why did you take this request?"

"Because it's a mystery!"

*I already knew, but wow... she really is an oddball.*

Leo let out a quiet chuckle to himself.
