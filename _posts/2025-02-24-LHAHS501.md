"Lady Luna, how are you here?" Carl looked at her in surprise.

Chen Xia smiled. "I'm more surprised that you recognized Lady Luna right away."

"What?" Carl, flustered by Chen Xia's words, soon made an 'ah, right' expression.

While he was shocked at Luna's presence, true to his nature as the most composed among the second years, he quickly returned to his usual smiling face.

"Oh?" Luna let out a sound of admiration. "So, he seems to have figured out your identity? Did you know?"

"No, I didn't." Leo shook his head as Luna playfully poked his side.

Seeing his closest friend covering his face in embarrassment, Leo was just as surprised.

On the path leading to the club building, Leo, sitting on a bench, asked, "When did you realize it?"

Carl, sitting next to Leo, wore a sheepish expression. "I first felt something was off in Sir Dweno's world. You were too familiar with the history, events, and culture of that world. Plus, you were completely at ease with Lady Velkia, Sir Aaron, and Sir Dweno."

Acting was essential in the Hero World. One had to behave as naturally as possible, like someone from that era, and interact with others the way the people of that time did.

Even considering all that, Leo's demeanor had been a little strange. It was a subtle feeling that only the keen-eyed Carl could perceive.

*It was as if they were the same as us, his friends from school. Or like he was reuniting with old friends.*

"And then, during summer break, I saw you with Sir Aaron and got a vague hunch."

Piece by piece, Carl, the closest person to Leo, had put together the pieces of the puzzle. 

His extraordinary growth speed. His continuous connections with the Great Heroes. And being in the same all-class as the Hero of the Beginning.

Moreover, for some reason, every time the words 'no way' crossed his mind, the suspicion that Leo might be Kyle only grew stronger.

Leo let out a hollow laugh. "I was careless."

"Rather than that, maybe I was just too perceptive?" Carl chuckled.

"Why didn't you tell me that you figured out I was Kyle?"

"I was itching to say something, but the you I know is Leo Plov." Carl grinned at Leo. "Not the Hero of the Beginning, Kyle, but my friend, Leo."

From the very first moment at the entrance ceremony, Leo had treated everyone equally. He naturally built friendships with those who approached him. Even though there were differences in status, he treated everyone without barriers.

At first, Carl had wondered why Leo behaved that way. Was it the composure and broad-mindedness of someone who had saved the world? As far as Carl remembered, however, Leo had always been sincere in everything he did.

When facing trials. When confronting those who challenged him head-on. And when rushing to the most dangerous places, comforting those who followed behind him.

That was why he had decided to treat Leo as a friend. No matter his true identity, to Carl, he was still his dearest friend.

"You're saying something quite mature, huh?" Luna cut in, popping her face between Leo and Carl.

"Ugh?!" Startled by her sudden appearance, Carl clutched his heart and tumbled off the bench.

Luna burst into laughter, clutching her stomach. Then, she approached Carl and held out her hand. "You're Carl Thomas, right?"

"Yes." Carl took Luna's hand and got up. 

As he brushed the dust off his pants, Luna said, "My name is Luna Luminance, but you can just call me Lu."

"Yes, Lady Lu."

"No, no. Just 'Lu'." Luna grinned and pointed at Leo. "You consider this guy your friend, right?"

"That's right."

"I'm his friend too."

With that, she casually draped an arm around Leo's shoulder. Leo, looking annoyed, pushed her face away with his hand.

Luna beamed. "Then that means we're friends too, doesn't it?"

Carl scratched his cheek. "Does it... work that way?"

"Of course. Unlike this arrogant guy, I'd love to have more friends." Luna pouted as she pinched Leo's hand, which was still pushing her face away. "You adorable little ones treat me too politely."

Shaking free from Leo's grip, Luna approached Chen Xia and Eiran and linked arms with both of them. Eiran looked absolutely honored, while Chen Xia smiled awkwardly.

"Are you sure it's okay to be friends with someone like me?"

"What's wrong with you?"

"I don't have much talent for magic, and I have no chance of becoming a hero."

"So what?" Luna chuckled. She let go of their arms and stepped beside Leo. "Do you think we saved the world with only our power, or that of the heroes who lived in the same era?"

"Wasn't that the case?" Eiran asked, looking puzzled.

"Wrong!" Luna laughed cheerfully.

Eiran's ears drooped.

Luna explained, "It was only possible because everyone of that time came together. Not just me, but Leo, Aaron, Dweno, and even Lysinas—none of us believe we saved the world by our strength alone."

Some people were certainly born with the power to accomplish greater things than others. Those who could illuminate the darkness and guide the way. Those who could take one step further into the unknown—people called them heroes.

But...

"It's up to people to choose the paths they want to walk." Luna twirled a lock of her hair with her fingertip. "In the end, the world was only saved with the help of the many people who supported us."

Carrying an era didn't mean that era was a burden. On the contrary, when they were about to fall, the people were the ones who held them up. Just as much as they gave help, they also received it.

In that sense, Luna believed that those who lived in the same era stood as equals.

"What's important is that you and I share the same time. In that sense..." Luna once again extended her hand toward Carl. "Let's do this again. My name is Luna Luminance. And you?"

Understanding what Luna wanted, Carl clasped her hand. "Carl Thomas."

Since that was what she wished, Carl decided to set aside everything else. After all, when the customer has a request, a merchant complies; and when a hero fighting on the battlefield has a request, a supporter complies.

"In that case..." Carl pulled something out of his subspace storage.

*Rustle—!*

Eiran gasped, "Huh?!"

"Wow!" Chen Xia let out an exclamation.

What Carl had taken out was none other than a collection book. A popular item among humans, it was an album filled with cards featuring illustrations of famous heroes.

"This must be really expensive," Chen Xia commented as he looked at the complete collection book.

Carl grinned. "It is."

Eiran swallowed hard.

"Ooh, it's pretty." Luna smiled brightly as she looked at a card featuring her illustration.

Carl pulled out a pen. "As your friend, I have a favor to ask. Could you sign these?"

"You want me to sign it?" Luna blinked in confusion.

"Yeah. Being friends doesn't mean I can't admire you, right? As a mage, I have great respect for the Nebula Pioneer, Luna Luminance," Carl said casually—so casually that Luna nodded and carefully signed each card without questioning it.

Finally, only when she was done, did Luna ask innocently, "But what's the point of having me sign it?"

Carl grinned widely. "To make me rich, of course."

Chen Xia narrowed her eyes. "Carl."

"Yeah?"

"You're going to be struck by divine punishment."

"It's fine. It's a request from a friend," Carl said shamelessly. "Anyway! Dinner's on me!"

"Ohhh! Are you sure?" Luna asked, clapping.

Carl smiled. "Yeah. I'm rich now."

With a cheerful mood, Luna and Carl walked ahead, while Chen Xia and Eiran hurriedly followed behind.

Watching their backs, Leo smiled.

*Whoooosh—!*

In the frigid northern lands of the continent, which now belonged to the elves, numerous nations existed. 

However, unlike human nations, the elves had no king.

During the Age of Calamity, despite being considered the most powerful race and holding immense influence over the continent, the elves fell helplessly to Tartaros's assault due to their own pride in their lineage. They had established a strong centralized rule under the Elf King, but when that central power became corrupt, they crumbled far too easily.

And after the Age of Calamity ended, the Fairy Knight Velkia Ersar, who had led the efforts to rebuild the world, abolished social classes in elven society. 

There were those who cried out for tradition, but the Elf King and the High Elves had already fallen. Under the ideology that all elves were equal, elven society was rebuilt.

Nevertheless, as time passed, ideals dulled.

Thousands of years later, the elves once again became intoxicated with their own superiority. Their beauty, superior magic abilities, and affinity with elementals were more than enough to convince them that elves were a special race above all others. 

Then, when Seiren appeared and elves became the undisputed masters of magic, they grew even more convinced of their own superiority.

From this belief, the Pureblood Society was born, but even the Pureblood Society had recently lost its power… and because of none other than Seiren, the very existence that had led to their formation in the first place.

With a single statement, Seiren had denied the very existence of the Pureblood Society. The foundation of the Pureblood Society was shaken, and as the betrayals of several key members came to light, its standing plummeted further.

Still, that didn't mean a group that had taken root in elven society for thousands of years could simply vanish overnight.

"I cannot accept this. A human possessing an elven treasure!" One elf spoke with an expression full of indignation.

"Even if Lady Seiren has acknowledged Leo Plov as her successor... Cometes is an elven treasure."

"Some fools claim that since it was Lady Seiren's staff, we must follow her will... but Cometes originally belonged to Lady Luna. The idea that Lady Seiren alone can decide to hand it over to a human is preposterous."

"A delegation has been sent to Leo Plov in time for the Twilight Festival. We intend to formally demand the return of Cometes."

A heated debate was underway at the Pureblood Society's meeting.

One of the elves listening furrowed his brows. "But why have you called me here?"

His name was Rune Ersar, and he was the acting headmaster of Seiren and one of the elder elves. A being of immense power.

However, he had lived his entire life far removed from the Pureblood Society. Or rather, from their perspective, he was an elf they could never welcome.

His ideology was considered highly progressive, even among elves.

Which was why Rune was feeling extremely irritated right now.

*I was reading Eiran's letter!*

He had been reading a letter from his granddaughter when he was summoned to hear this nonsense. Of course, his head hurt.

*I thought this was going to be a constructive meeting about dissolving the Pureblood Society.*

As Rune displayed his displeasure, one of the Pureblood Society elves said, "Sir Rune, you are a descendant of the great Lady Velkia, are you not?"

"As the disciple of Lady Luna, should you not follow her will?"

At those words, Rune let out a hollow laugh inwardly.

*So, now that Lady Seiren has denied them, they plan to put Lady Velkia at the forefront?*

It was the Pureblood Society's fault that Velkia, once considered one of the three greatest elven figures, had lost prominence.

Velkia, who had rebuilt the world, was an elf who emphasized unity with other races. Such teachings were, of course, unacceptable to the Pureblood Society. That was why, despite being Luna's disciple, Velkia had gradually faded from elven memory.

The Ersar family remained a prestigious house, but considering Velkia's achievements and stature, their influence was relatively minor. 

Of course, the Ersar family had never cared about that. They had simply upheld their ancestor's progressive ideals.

However, now that Seiren had denounced the Pureblood Society, the Pureblood Society was attempting to change their patron elf hero from Seiren to Velkia.

Rather than accept Seiren's rejection, it was more convenient for them to twist the teachings of Velkia, who had lived 5,000 years ago, to suit their own agenda.

As Rune watched the Pureblood Society desecrate his ancestor's legacy, a cold smile formed on his lips.

*Creaaak—!*

The doors of the meeting room suddenly swung open.

"How dare you barge in when we are discussing matters of great importance to our race!" the highest-ranking elf of the Pureblood Society shouted in fury.

*Step, step—*

The sound of wet footsteps echoed. Then, stepping into view was an elven woman, drenched in blood, holding a sword from which blood dripped.

"W-What?!"

"Who are you?!"

Cries of shock and outrage erupted throughout the Pureblood Society as powerful mana surged through the room. 

Still, every single elf here was a master of Stellar Magic. Their ideologies might be twisted, but that didn't mean they lacked skill.

*Splat—!*

However, before their spells could even be completed, in an instant, an elf of the Pureblood Society had their head sent flying.

From that moment on, it became a massacre.

The elven woman's blade tore through the Pureblood Society with terrifying speed, until finally, the last sword strike turned toward Rune.

*Clang—!*

Rune blocked her blade, but almost immediately after, his eyes widened in shock.

*Splat—!*

Blood splattered onto his chest.

*Squelch—*

The elven woman ran her hand over her chest. Had Rune swung with full intent to kill, she might have been mortally wounded. That was how skilled Rune was.

However, he couldn't bring himself to swing his sword completely… and neither could she.

"Thank goodness... You take after Myde more than me."

With a voice carrying both relief and bitterness, the elven woman stepped forward.

*Squelch—*

Rune rose to his feet and looked at her.

"You are no traitor. Will you not step aside?" she asked kindly.

However, Rune coughed up blood as he replied, "Why...?"

She smiled bitterly. "Because someone has to do it."

Rune shook his head. "O great ancestor... This... This is not right. The you I knew would never do this."

"You sound just like Bihar." Velkia thought of a lifelong friend who had lived in darkness under the same master. "Is this what Bihar felt when she looked at me back then?"

She knew that the descendant before her was a noble hero. He had likely spent his life embracing the world with a brilliant light.

To keep her name untainted. To follow her ideals.

But...

"I'm sorry. This is who I am."

Velkia vanished, and Rune blacked out.

{sep}

Velkia left the Pureblood Society behind.

*He won't die, but… I've let him down.*

Recalling Rune, who had failed to strike her down, Velkia smiled bitterly.

Beneath the night sky, she looked down at her hands.

*Crunch, crunch—*

Snow fell, but the snowflakes that landed on her body did not melt.

*Crunch—*

A snowflake landed on her palm.

She remembered how fascinating she had found the sight of white snow when she first saw it.

"I cannot accept it." Dark emotions flickered in Velkia's eyes. "To trample upon their sacrifice... To let the living carry on as if nothing happened... I cannot accept that."
