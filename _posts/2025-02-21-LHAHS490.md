The entire village was covered in beautiful, blooming flowers.

Just a few days ago, the village had been filled with the essence of autumn. Now, it was as if spring had arrived.

As Chen Xia had described, it was a rural village known for its retreats, yet it had a large inn.

"Wow, we can rent an entire annex?" Eiran exclaimed in amazement as they were shown to their lodging.

Having rented an entire annex, they also had access to its garden.

In the garden, there was a small pond.

"It has a wonderful atmosphere."

Eiran, seemingly quite satisfied with the Eastern-style inn—something rare in elven society—stepped outside into the garden.

She gazed at the ornamental fish swimming in the pond with sparkling eyes, then began picking the flowers that filled the garden while humming a tune.

Watching her carefree demeanor, Chen Xia rested her chin on her hand as she sat on the floor of the living room overlooking the garden.

"Eiran is such a lovely girl."

"You sound like someone who's been through everything in life. You're both the same age."

"...Sir Leo, the one who keeps treating us like kids, is actually the youngest one here." Chen Xia narrowed her eyes and shot Leo a look as he sat down. "But still, this scenery is amazing. It's really something."

Scattered across the ground were fallen autumn leaves, as if spring and autumn coexisted.

*An elf girl and a field of flowers... it's like a painting.*

Chen Xia smiled as she admired the sight of Eiran.

Then, she turned her gaze back to Leo.

"......" Leo sat still, arms crossed, staring up at the ceiling.

Seeing this, Chen Xia let out a small sigh and stood up. She knelt behind Leo and placed her hands on his shoulders, gently massaging them.

"What are you doing all of a sudden?" Leo tilted his head back to look at Chen Xia.

Chen Xia smiled down at him. "I'm giving you a massage. Feels nice, doesn't it?"

"You're pretty good at this." Leo nodded at the soft touch of Chen Xia's hands on his shoulders. Then he tilted his head slightly. "But why?"

"It just felt like Sir Leo was about to take on another difficult task again." Chen Xia softly kneaded his shoulders as she spoke. "I was surprised when you suddenly suggested going flower-viewing, but at the same time, I was relieved. It made me think that Sir Leo was finally taking some time to rest."

"I always get plenty of rest."

"That's not the kind of rest I'm talking about." Chen Xia said slightly sulkily. "I'm talking about completely letting go of everything and resting properly. Ever since enrolling at Lumene, you've always been caught up in major incidents. Even during this break, it wasn't exactly a relaxing time. Hasn't it always been like that?"

Leo could feel the small hands on his shoulders tighten slightly.

"I suppose so. But I never really thought about whether I needed rest," he replied.

"Well, I think it's very important." Chen Xia's hands softened again as she gently massaged Leo's shoulders. "Judging by your expression though, you came here for a reason, didn't you?"

"Yeah."

"I won't ask what it is." 

Chen Xia lowered herself to sit beside Leo and looked up at him.

Leo looked down at her.

"But at least for today, please forget about everything and just rest. This place was meant to be a retreat for Shadows whenever they needed to recover."

"I see. No wonder this place is so well-developed for such a remote village, despite its beautiful scenery. So that was the reason."

"Yes. This place actually has a long history and tradition. Long ago, Lady Bihar used it as a place of seclusion."

"Bihar did?"

Leo looked slightly surprised, and Chen Xia smiled softly before resuming the massage.

At that moment, Eiran, still in the garden, called out with a bright smile. "Sir Leo! Chen Xia! Look at this!"

Turning their heads, they saw her holding up the ends of her skirt with both hands.

Since she was wearing casual clothes, the hem was long, creating a basket-like shape filled with flowers.

"Aren't they beautiful?!"

"They really are." Chen Xia smiled brightly.

"You're right. I'll take the day off, so go have fun too."

"Huh? But I haven't finished your massage yet."

"I'm already feeling much better thanks to you." Leo smirked.

"Sir Leo, do you want to come play too?"

"Yes! Come play with us!"

"You want *me* to play with flowers?" Leo said incredulously.

Hearing Leo's indifferent response, the two girls immediately ran off to the garden without any hesitation.

*At the end of the day, they're still just kids.*

Leo chuckled as he watched the two of them enjoy themselves like ordinary girls their age, happily admiring the flowers.

*Rest, huh...*

5000 years ago, from the moment he took Lysinas' hand, that word had become foreign to Leo.

And not just to him.

His friends must have been the same.

*Well, back then, no one had the luxury to relax and forget about everything.*

Even after reincarnation, it was the same. He had lived with only one goal—to subjugate Erebos.

His body never felt exhausted, nor was his divine power ever worn down. To always maintain peak condition, he meticulously took care of himself.

But, as Chen Xia had pointed out, he had never truly given himself a moment to breathe. 

He couldn't. There were still so many things left unresolved.

*This place was a frequent retreat for Bihar, and just earlier, I accessed a memory through spirit summoning magic, though I don't know whose it was.*

Leo organized the clues one by one.

*And then there's the statice flowers, which should have gone extinct long ago, blooming everywhere. Somewhere near here is the grave Lysinas and I built for Luna... as well as the one Velkia prepared for me.*

Leo picked up a flower petal that had drifted through the large gate leading to the garden.

*This flower must be connected to the bouquet Lysinas gave Velkia the night before our final campaign.*

Too many clues were jumbled in his mind.

*Could the Lich King have resurrected Bihar as an undead?*

He recalled his disciple, who had never been able to let go of her hatred for humanity, but soon, he shook his head.

*No, like Chen Xia said, I should take the day off.*

His gaze landed on Chen Xia, weaving flowers into a crown, and Eiran, clapping her hands with laughter as she watched.

A warm smile spread across his face.

*Somehow, this turned into a vacation.*

Soaking in the hot spring, Leo blankly gazed up at the sky. The night sky was filled with stars, as if they were about to pour down at any moment.

"Looking at it like this, Chen Xia is amazing. How should I put it... you're incredible."

"Hehe, thanks for the compliment."

Beyond the wall, the two girls' cheerful conversation could be heard.

"Sir Leo, isn't this nice?"

"Yeah."

"Sir Leo, the night sky is so beautiful."

"It is."

Leo lazily replied, affirming their words. Meanwhile, on the other side of the wall, Eiran was admiring the sky in awe, but Chen Xia pouted slightly.

"Sir Leo, isn't this a bit much?" she asked.

"What is?" Eiran tilted her head at Chen Xia's slightly sulky voice.

"Just one wall away, two beautiful girls are bathing, yet you're so indifferent."

At those words, Eiran gave an awkward smile.

"You're not even the slightest bit flustered. You're like some jaded old man."

Eiran scratched her cheek as she listened to Chen Xia grumble in mild dissatisfaction. Even earlier, when he treated them like kids... Chen Xia was a little riled up by Leo's attitude.

*Well, Leo isn't a kid, after all.*

He might look young, but inside, he was an adult, and not just any adult, either.

He was a Great Hero from 5000 years ago, and the mentor of Velkia and Bihar, the founders of their own families. 

*I suppose it's only natural that we look like children to him.*

She dipped her lips beneath the water and exhaled.

*Blub blub—*

As bubbles popped on the surface, Chen Xia grumbled, "We're older than him, though."

"Well... I guess so?" Eiran gave an awkward smile at Chen Xia's sudden assertion of seniority.

"Don't you want to hear Sir Leo sound flustered for once?"

"How?"

Chen Xia playfully winked and then said, "Sir Leo, since we're on vacation, why don't we bathe together? I'll scrub your back!"

At Chen Xia's outrageous statement, Eiran gasped and opened and closed her mouth like a fish. It seemed that Chen Xia figured that unless she went this far, Leo wouldn't even blink.

"Well, should I?"

*Swoosh—!*

However, Leo was unfazed. The sound of water splashing was followed by footsteps approaching the wall.

*Squelch, squelch—*

"Are you coming over, or should I?"

Chen Xia froze at Leo's unexpected response. "Huh? Ah! I-I mean! I-I don't mind, but I'm the only one... No, no! I was joking! I just wanted to tease Sir Leo a little...!"

Normally, Chen Xia wouldn't even flinch at most things. Yet now, her face turned bright red as she stammered in a panic.

"Don't joke about things like this."

Beyond the wall, Leo's amused voice rang out, followed by the sound of water splashing as he sank back in.

*Ugh... I lost. He never loses at these things.*

Chen Xia buried her face in the hot spring to hide her flushed expression.

"Aww, what a shame," Eiran sighed.

"Huh?" Startled by Eiran's voice, Chen Xia lifted her head. 

Seeing her dumbfounded look, Eiran flinched and hastily tried to explain. "I-I read in a book that in human society, men and women sometimes share baths when traveling! I just thought... it would be a cultural experience... a good opportunity, maybe..."

"What kind of books have you been reading? That's not a thing. Or at least, it's not common. Wait, was it some kind of weird novel? Unless it was a strange book, there's no way..."

Eiran quickly turned her head away, avoiding eye contact. Watching her, Chen Xia mumbled blankly to herself.

*She looks so innocent, but her reading habits are dangerous.*

*Whooooosh—!*

The world was engulfed in black flames. The monstrous Primordial Evil spewed forth a fire that seemed to bear the weight of the entire world.

*Boom—! Flash—!*

A golden aura surged toward the gray sky, as if it would tear it apart. A man with gray hair, gripping a sword, narrowed his eyes and charged forward.

"K-Kyle! Don't go ahead alone!" Luna frantically called out to Kyle.

"Luna, your shoulder comes first. Kyle will buy time, so take this chance." Lysinas ran over to Luna. 

Gritting her teeth, Luna began healing the wound that had pierced through her right shoulder.

*Swoosh—!*

Meanwhile, a sword strike powerful enough to split the world came crashing down toward Erebos.

*Fwoooosh—!*

Golden aura slashed through the giant wreathed in black flames. Kyle's gray eyes met Erebos' blood-red gaze midair.

[Interesting.] Erebos muttered in a low voice. [So, you have accepted death, Surviving Hero.]

Mocking the resolve reflected in Kyle's eyes, Erebos let out a sneer.

*Clench—!*

Erebos grabbed onto the golden aura embedded in his body. Then, it pulled it out and raised its other hand.

*Whoosh—!*

A sword of black fire formed. Kyle, seeing this, lifted the sword in his own hand.

*Flash—! Kwang—! Whoooosh—!*

The sword swung by Erebos bore down on Kyle.

*Kwagagagang—!*

The ground beneath Kyle crumbled and sank. 

Compared to Erebos, Kyle was tiny. It wouldn't have been strange if he were crushed and erased in an instant. 

Yet, Kyle's gray eyes showed no despair. Instead, they burned even fiercer with murderous intent.

*Whoooosh—!*

A tidal wave of black flames poured out from Erebos' sword. Flames that looked like they would reduce Kyle to ashes at any moment.

The fire engulfed Kyle's hand gripping the sword, and his face twisted in agony.

Seeing this, Luna shouted, "There's no time to worry about injuries!"

Gripping her staff, Luna rushed forward.

*Jolt—!*

Leo sat up abruptly. His shoulders rose and fell in an uncharacteristic manner. Cold sweat drenched his body.

The dream had felt so real. Recalling what he had just seen, Leo took a deep breath.

*The third battle of the final campaign.*

It was the battle in which Luna had died.

*Strange. To dream of that moment so vividly...*

It felt as if he had just been on that battlefield moments ago. 

Leo pressed his right hand against the ground, trying to get up.

"Kuh?!"

However, a searing pain flared in his right shoulder, making his strength falter.

*Squelch—!*

As he collapsed back down, he noticed that the blanket beneath him was damp.

*Blood?*

The metallic scent of blood filled his nose. Leo placed his left hand over his right shoulder.

For a moment, he felt a wound, but almost instantly, it disappeared as if it had never been there.

The pain was gone too. Only the wet blood soaking his bedding remained as proof that he had been injured.

Leo's expression darkened in confusion. "What the fuck...?"
