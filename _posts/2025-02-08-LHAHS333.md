After class, Leo visited Mel's office and told her about the exchange program.

Mel widened her eyes in surprise. "Exchange student?"

"Yes."

"Seiren, huh…? Even if you go, I don't think it will be particularly beneficial to you." Mel tilted her head as she poured herself tea. "Besides, if you go to Seiren now, most of the students there will be openly hostile to you."

As the Dragon Queen who appointed the vice principals of all hero academies, Mel was well aware of the political landscape within each institution.

Leo chuckled, "I've wanted to check it out at least once since I first heard about the exchange program."

"But… there will definitely be elves who treat you with disrespect."

Mel's expression turned cold. As someone who knew Leo's true identity as *Hero of the Beginning, Kyle*, she couldn't tolerate the idea of elven supremacists behaving rudely toward him.

Leo was the Great Hero who saved the world. If not for him, the current era wouldn't even exist.

"Just thinking about them showing you such disrespect… it's absolutely unforgivable."

*Rumble—!*

A heavy pressure radiated from Mel.

Fiora and Kiran, who had been casually exploring the office, flinched and hid behind a bookshelf.

Arty, who had been lying with her eyes closed, opened one eye to glance at Mel, while Elsie admired the sight.

Though usually gentle, Mel now exuded an aura befitting a Dragon Queen. Her eyes had even shifted into those of a dragon.

Leo, watching her, reached out and pinched her nose.

"Hnnrgh!" Startled, Mel covered her nose with both hands.

"Why are you getting so worked up over something that hasn't even happened yet?"

"B-But…" She said in a nasally voice, "I just can't accept it."

Leo rested his chin on his hand. "I'm used to arrogant elves looking down on me."

Back in the early days of the Calamity Era, elven pride and authority were still firmly ingrained.

Leo had encountered countless elves who refused to integrate with other races, causing endless discord.

"Besides, back in my time, the High Elves were still around. If anything, they were even worse than they are now."

Mel blinked before sighing, "Every time I talk to you, I realize something new."

"What?"

"That you're actually just a really old man… mmph!"

Once again, Leo pinched her nose, making Mel flail her arms in distress.

Arty, watching the scene, mumbled to herself, "I want to be trampled by the Dragon Queen. Then, I want to be trampled by my master, who can so easily subdue the Dragon Queen."

Elsie let out a deep sigh. [Please maintain your dignity as a Pegasus.]

Of course, Arty ignored her.

After scolding Mel, Leo continued, "I'm not going to Seiren just for Kiran's wing."

"Then why?"

"I'm going there to see what kind of hero candidates Seiren has. The only ones I know well are Lunia and Eiran."

For an ordinary person, scouting hero candidates wouldn't mean much. However, when Leo sought out hero candidates, the weight of his words was entirely different.

Because to him, *hero candidates* meant those who could carry the burden of the era. They were those who could stand against *Tartarus*, or even against *Erebos* itself.

Mel nodded in understanding. *The heroes chosen by Leo, the rightful owner of the Hero Record and the greatest hero of all time, would be different.*

"And if Seiren is that rotten from the inside, then someone needs to help fix it."

Leo knew all too well how the world had spiraled toward destruction during the Calamity Era.

While Erebos itself was an unfathomable monster that even the gods could not handle, many factions had collapsed not because they lacked power but because they self-destructed from internal strife.

Elves, despite being one of the most powerful factions, had crumbled far too easily.

Tina feared that Seiren would become obsolete and wanted Leo to shake things up by making an impact.

However, Leo, having seen firsthand how the once-mighty elves had fallen, was concerned for the entire elven race. He knew that Seiren needed to change to avoid repeating history.

Mel looked worried. "I hope that happens, but… the exchange program only lasts a month at most. Can you really change that much in such a short time?"

"Lunia and Eiran are already there. All I need to do is give them a reason." Leo smirked. "If they're truly meant to be heroes, just a spark should be enough."

Just as Mel nodded in understanding…

*Knock, knock!*

Someone urgently knocked on her office door.

"It's open," Mel said.

The door swung open, and Anna entered.

"Assistant Professor Anna? What brings you here?"

"Leo! Right now, Professor Len just heard about the exchange program from Professor Tina and…!"

Leo and Mel exchanged glances before immediately rising from their seats.

Principal Rina sighed deeply. "So, what you're saying, Professor Len, is that we should immediately expel Professor Tina from the academy?"

"That is correct, Principal! We must banish that treacherous elf at once… Mmph!"

Before he could finish his outburst, Rina clamped a hand over Len's mouth.

Even as Len thrashed, Tina calmly sipped her tea as if none of this concerned her.

The moment Len had heard about the exchange program, he had gone into a frenzy.

Anna had rushed to fetch Leo and Mel, and with their help, they had barely managed to restrain him.

But Len's rampage hadn't stopped.

Soon, other professors had rushed in, and the whole incident had escalated to the principal's office.

Rina wore a tired expression. "I have no idea how Kalian managed to run this school for decades. These professors cause chaos every other day."

"Kalian just dumped all these problems onto Professor Harrid," Anna replied.

"Hmm. That's… tempting." 

Rina stroked her chin, deep in thought. Ignoring Len, who was still struggling, she turned to Tina.

"Professor Tina. I'd like to know why you recommended Leo for the exchange program and on what authority you can even send him."

"I suggested it because I want Seiren's students to realize that there are outstanding students like Leo. I also believe this would be a good opportunity for Leo to broaden his horizons."

Tina's response was straight out of a textbook.

"And as for my authority to request an exchange student, I simply need to submit a formal request to my family."

Though Tina had to keep her status as a direct descendant a secret, her magical knowledge was so exceptional that even Seiren's *Tingel* family acknowledged her abilities.

She had successfully deciphered several of *Seiren Tingel's* ancient spells—ones that had remained unsolved for thousands of years.

As a result, while she had no fame outside of her family, she wielded considerable influence within it.

"Even though I'm neither from Seiren nor have lived a life related to heroes, I believe that Leo going to Seiren will be beneficial for both him and Seiren."

"Hmm."

"Principal! You must not be deceived! This is a sinister plot to take Leo away to Seiren…!"

"Yes, yes. Calm down, Professor Len."

"Be quiet."

Mel smiled brightly as she pacified Len, while Anna covered his mouth.

After some thought, Rina turned to Leo. "What do you think, Leo?"

"I'd like to go."

"If it's a good opportunity and he wants to, then why not?" Rina said casually. "If this exchange program benefits both sides, it wouldn't be a bad idea. I'll need to discuss this with Sedgen. Professor Tina, since you proposed this, I'd like you to handle the exchange procedures on Seiren's side."

"Understood."

Rina had been interested in the idea of an exchange program since last year.

*Now is the time to strengthen cooperation between hero academies. Seiren might not be too fond of Leo, but…*

She could already predict how Seiren would react to Leo's presence.

Glancing at him, Rina thought, *On the surface, this would be an ideal step toward fostering inter-school relations, just like the Lumeiren Games.*

If Seiren sent exchange students in return, there was nothing bad about it for Lumene either.

Tina nodded and left for her office.

Meanwhile, Len sat in despair as things moved in an unintended direction.

Leo called out to him. "Professor Len, Assistant Professor Anna's upcoming presentation at the magic conference on [Introduction to Stellar Magic] lists me as a co-author, so I will assist her in the presentation during my time as an exchange student."

Rina nodded. "Right, since you're already going, you might as well help Assistant Professor Anna."

After Leo left, Rina sighed and tried to calm Len down. "Professor Len, just relax. It's not like Leo will suddenly become a Seiren student just because he's going there as an exchange…"

"Heh… Hehehehe." Len let out a low chuckle.

Rina flinched. *Oh no, what now?*

"I have a great idea."

"And that is?" Anna looked at him warily.

"If Leo goes to Seiren and those knife-eared bastards hate him, all the better! Hahaha! They despise [Introduction to Stellar Magic]!" Len clutched his face, his expression filled with madness. "We'll prepare a conference presentation that will provoke those damn elves to the extreme! Assistant Professor Anna! I will personally attend this conference!"

Anna's face turned ice cold. "…This is *my* conference."

Preparing for the magic conference had been an immense source of stress for her, but being invited to present at an international gathering of the world's top mages was also an incredible honor.

For any mage, giving a lecture at a major magic conference was a mark of prestige.

That was why, despite the pressure and exhaustion, Anna had poured everything into preparing for it.

And now, Len was suddenly claiming the entire event as his own.

Moreover, from what he was saying, it was clear he intended to alter the presentation she had prepared.

"Assistant Professor Anna! Don't worry! I will take full charge of this conference!"

"Shut up!" Anna, finally reaching her limit, snapped with a ferocious glare.

Rina, watching the scene, intervened. "Professor Len, sorry, but you can't go to Seiren."

"Why not!?"

"You personally created the entire curriculum for the second-year magic department. Who else could handle it? You even got approval for it yesterday."

Len had planned an academic schedule that no one but himself could execute, and he had already received official approval.

In other words, if he left, the entire second-year magic department's curriculum would be thrown into disarray.

"Principal, I'll redo the schedule. Assistant Professor Anna can handle the lectures in my place."

"If that's what you really want, then go." Rina's voice turned cold. "But first, hand in your resignation letter."

"T-That's…"

Len's face fell into despair.

*Tap— Tap tap—*

The sound of chalk scratching against a blackboard echoed through the empty classroom.

In the vast lecture hall, there were only two elves.

In the center of the room, a single desk was occupied by a Seiren student with red eyes, staring at the board filled with writing.

"Lunia, do you understand now? The purpose for which the Comet Mage founded Seiren?" A strict-looking Seiren instructor asked.

Lunia replied with a sweet smile. "Yes, I understand now."

"That is a relief! It seems you are finally returning to your former self. This proves the thought reformation classes are working!" The instructor, beaming, checked his watch. "That concludes today's supplementary lesson."

Dinner time had already passed.

"Good work, Lunia. Let's continue in the same place tomorrow."

"Yes, Mr. Orlen."

Lunia bowed gracefully, and Orlen left the classroom with a satisfied expression.

As soon as she was alone, her demeanor changed entirely.

"Thought reformation, my ass. Do they really think I care about this nonsense?"

The blackboard was covered with ideals about what it meant to be a proper elf.

Lunia, now looking like a delinquent, kicked the classroom walls.

"And I'm starving on top of that! How the hell am I supposed to study when I haven't even eaten?!"

After raging for a while, she slumped into her chair with her legs crossed and rested her chin on her hand.

Outside, snow was falling.

Staring at the pure white landscape, Lunia muttered, "Maybe I really should just drop out."
