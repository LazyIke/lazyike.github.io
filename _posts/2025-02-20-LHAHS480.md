[Sigh... So, such things are happening in the northeastern part of the continent right now. Regarding the Justice Guild, that is my negligence. I failed to manage them properly and allowed such filth to taint your eyes and ears, Sir Leo.]

"That's not something you need to apologize for," Leo said flatly, taking a sip of the herb-infused tea he had brewed to ward off the chill of the autumn dawn.

[Should I mobilize other hero guilds or Lumene?] Mel asked.

"No. If we handle this poorly, it could lead to civil war. Justice is still a massive organization. Moving against them officially isn't a good idea."

Leo had more than enough power to bring down the Justice Guild. At his word, Shadows from all over the world would move, and the Dragon Queen, too, was practically his spokesperson. 

However, that didn't mean there wouldn't be any consequences, especially when dealing with those incapable of rational thought.

*With the Lich King still active, it's best not to engage in self-destructive battles.*

"Just exposing their true nature should be enough to achieve results. Right now, the most urgent matter is securing the hero graves scattered across the world."

[Yes, if word gets out that the Lich King is resurrecting heroes as undead, the world will be thrown into chaos.]

"That's inevitable."

Leo let out a deep sigh. Since ancient times, the undead had been objects of disgust and scorn for the living, but if heroes recorded in the Hero Record were turned into undead?

*Their honor would be trampled into the dirt.*

If the hero had left no legacy behind, that would be the end of it, but if their descendants had formed a faction, it would become a much bigger issue. Their ancestor's honor would be destroyed.

*That alone could split the world apart.*

Leo sighed deeply.

*I need to find a way to preserve the honor of the fallen heroes.*

His eyes narrowed. "If we consider the worst-case scenario, which hero would be our biggest threat?"

[The worst case would be the Nether Knight, Thamus. Especially considering that the land you are currently in was once under his rule... It's possible that the Lich King's goal is to resurrect him as an undead.]

Leo frowned and blinked in puzzlement. "Is the Nether Knight really that impressive? From what I heard, he refused to cooperate with the Heroes of Dawn out of jealousy. Few of his achievements are listed in the Hero Record, too."

Many past heroes had faded into obscurity, so it wasn't unusual for records of Thamus to be scarce. For Leo, who didn't know much about him, Mel's serious reaction felt strange.

[Before the Heroes of Dawn rose to prominence, he was considered the most powerful hero in the world. You know that, right?]

"Yeah."

[He was so strong that Rodia herself once considered him as a candidate for the Heroes of Dawn. In fact, he fought alongside Rodia when she conquered Lysinas's world.]

"He did?"

Dragons were beings that chose heroes, and the Rodia Leo had met was incredibly intelligent. She was a wise dragon befitting the title of Lysinas's successor. If Rodia had willingly fought alongside Thamus, then his skills must have been genuine.

[In the records of the Calamity's Return, it was written that he had enough power to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Heroes of Dawn.]

"Why did such a hero turn his back on the world's crisis?"

[The Nether Knight challenged the Hero Worlds many times, but for some reason, he never once received a conquest reward.]

"And that was enough for him to abandon the world?"

[...That wasn't the only reason.]

"Then what?"

Mel hesitated briefly before opening a small Warp Gate, sending a book to where Leo was. It was one of Rodia's journals, kept in Dragonia's archives and accessible only to the Dragon Queen.

*This one's different from the records I read before. Is it a diary?*

The previous record he had seen from Rodia felt more like an official documentation, filled with careful wording.

*That prissy lizard.*

Clicking his tongue as he recalled his past encounter with Rodia, Leo flipped open the journal and quickly skimmed through its contents. Before long, he reached the part about Emperor Thamus of Talim.

*Was he a spirit medium? And not just any, but one who commanded countless spirits.*

Before being a knight, he was an immensely powerful spirit medium who led a knight order composed entirely of spirits, using relics of past heroes as mediums.

*His abilities were similar to Lysinas's.*

Leo was impressed. It was clear why Rodia had once considered Thamus as a hero who could save the world, but beyond mentions of his power, much of the journal contained concerns.

[Just as Lysinas first accepted Kyle as a comrade, I too have, by chance, taken a human as my first companion. However, he is different from Kyle. Kyle had a rough personality, but... Thamus possesses an arrogant nature and a cruel disposition. Can I truly guide him down the right path?]

Rodia's greatest concern about Thamus was his personality.

Afterward, Rodia was joined by the Grand Warrior Azonia, followed by the Comet Mage Seiren, then came the Unyielding Shield Damien.

While Thamus's troubling personality remained a concern, Rodia's party grew stronger with each successful conquest of Hero World. However, unlike the others who had received rewards from the Great Heroes' worlds, Thamus never obtained a single conquest reward.

Then came the turning point.

[Today, I met a human named Lumene. He is a hero who conquered Kyle's World alone.]

Rodia's first meeting with Lumene was met with great excitement in her writing, even more so than when she had met her other companions.

"Wait a minute." Sensing something in the writing, Leo lifted his eyes from the journal and looked at Mel. "Was Rodia... in love with Lumene?"

[Yes, it seems to have been love at first sight.]

"Really? Did Lumene know about it?"

[Dragonia preserves the journals of the Heroes of Dawn. When I read Lumene's diary, it seemed he was aware of Rodia's feelings. It left him in quite a predicament.]

"Why was it a predicament?"

[Because Seiren also had feelings for Lumene. Isn't it romantic?]

Leo let out a dry chuckle. "Yeah, I can see why it was a problem. Knowing Rodia and Seiren's personalities, they must have pursued him quite aggressively."

[No, neither of them ever pursued Lumene.]

"Did they act shy or something? I guess that makes sense. The con artist lizard and that thug elf from our side sure pretended to be all coy, too."

[Actually... Rodia and Seiren... It seems neither of them fully understood their own feelings for Lumene. Only Lumene himself was aware.]

"......" Leo's expression turned deadly.

Mel blinked, flustered. [Sir Leo?]

*So, those two didn't just fail to understand other people's feelings… they didn't even understand their own? And yet, they had the audacity to call me a dense idiot?*

Grinding his teeth, Leo recalled the two of them giving him those scornful looks, criticizing him for not recognizing Luna and Lysinas's feelings.

"Those damn brats...! Next time I see them, I'll shave their heads bald!"

Watching Leo growl in anger, Mel shrank back. Calling the Heroes of Dawn brats and threatening to shave their heads was something only a Great Hero could say.

Clenching his teeth, Leo continued reading the journal.

The next part of the story unfolded.

*The Nether Knight had feelings for Rodia and was jealous of Lumene. Ultimately, because of that, he strayed from the party, was expelled, and even refused to help in the final battle against Erebos?*

Leo let out a dry chuckle.

*This guy's completely insane.*

In a moment where the fate of the world was at stake, he let jealousy blind him and turned his back on it all?

*Just how selfish can someone be?*

With an incredulous expression, Leo closed the journal.

"Afterward, when the Heroes of Dawn far surpassed him in fame and people mocked him, the Nether Knight was consumed by rage. He then challenged Lumene to a duel to the death, only to have his head cut off. The Talim Empire, in order to conceal the disgrace of its founding emperor, covered up the event and requested Dragonia to erase all Hero Record entries related to the Nether Knight's demise."

It seemed that even the Heroes of Dawn had wished for their former comrade to be remembered with at least a shred of dignity.

*Though now, he's nothing but a subject of ridicule.*

Leo thought back to the modern perception of the Nether Knight. In this era, he was known as a powerful warrior who had abandoned the world for his own self-interest—a coward. He had even heard some Lumene students mock him as a fake hero.

*With a personality like that, it would surprise me if he fell and join forces with the Lich King.*

As Leo narrowed his eyes, thinking about the Nether Knight, he sensed a disturbing presence above him.

*Woooooooong—!*

He tilted his head back and looked up at the sky.

*The Lich King's aura.*

Realizing what it was, Leo narrowed his eyes and stood up.

[Sir Leo?] Mel called out in confusion.

"Looks like we have a guest."

"Strictly speaking, you are the guest," a voice to Leo's side said.

Leo turned his head. "Archduke of Mourning."

"It has been a while, Sir Leo Plov... no." Artkan bowed deeply toward Leo. "The Hero of the Beginning, Sir Kyle."

Leo raised his hand. "Since you're showing yourself before me, does that mean you're ready to die?"

*Woooooooooong—!*

A chilling aura flowed from Leo's body.

Faced with the overwhelming killing intent, Artkan narrowed his eyes.

*Hell Kaiser sent me to gauge just how strong the Hero of the Beginning is right now, but...*

The power Leo radiated was overwhelming.

*The current generation of legion commanders will be wiped out effortlessly.*

Even without divine authority, a legion commander was a demon who could instill terror across the world simply by mobilizing their forces, yet Leo made them look insignificant.

Artkan bowed his head. "I would love to entertain you, but... today, I am merely a guide."

"A guide?"

"There is another who wishes to meet you. You could consider him a distant successor of yours."

[Hear me, all who dwell in this land.]

A voice filled with oppressive power shook the entire capital.

[I, Thamus, ruler of Talim and your true master, have returned. Kneel immediately and worship me!]

Looking up at the sky, Leo remarked, "I don't recall ever having a successor like that."
