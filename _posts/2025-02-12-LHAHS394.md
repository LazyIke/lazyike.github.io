The expedition continued its journey.

They soon arrived near the location where Leo had predicted the King of Gluttony, Jörmungandr, would be. As a result, the expedition members wore tense expressions.

"Let's rest here for today," Lysinas said, even though there was still time before sunset.

They couldn't recklessly enter a danger zone where they might encounter Jörmungandr during the night. Thus, the expedition set up camp and prepared their meal.

*The atmosphere is heavy.*

Rodia lit a campfire with magic and surveyed the surroundings. Soon, they might have to fight Jörmungandr, the strongest of the legion commanders. It was only natural for them to feel tense.

*In this era, not a single legion commander has been defeated yet.*

They had set out on this expedition, risking their lives to slay Jörmungandr. Feeling anxious was inevitable.

After lighting the fire, Rodia approached Leo, who was looking at a map. "Sir Kyle."

"What?" Leo responded indifferently without lifting his gaze from the map.

Rodia hesitated before speaking. "Shouldn't we start explaining the plan to the expedition for defeating Jörmungandr?"

"There is no plan," Leo replied calmly.

"...What?"

Leo finally lifted his gaze and looked at Rodia. "Jörmungandr is not a legion commander that can be taken down with a plan."

She was baffled. "How does that make sense?"

"How? It just does. You've fought the King of Gluttony before, haven't you?"

Rodia recalled him—a legion commander with overwhelming power that could only be described as absolute. Even she, the leader of the Heroes of Dawn, couldn't help but shudder.

*Aside from the fragments of Erebos, he was the strongest enemy.*

He was, quite literally, the strongest demon.

"Unfortunately, he's not an opponent you can strategize against," Leo said with a small sigh. "Compared to my past life, the expedition's overall strength has certainly improved, and unlike back then, when we were forced into battle with Jörmungandr without preparation, we have made proper preparations this time. However."

Leo's voice hardened. "The fact that a single mistake can wipe out the entire expedition hasn't changed. Even the victory 5,000 years ago was nothing short of a miracle."

The only time they had gained the power to overwhelm Jörmungandr, both physically and mentally, was when they had reached the peak of their growth, becoming known as the Wise Queen and the Hero of the Beginning.

"Then how exactly did you defeat Jörmungandr back then?"

Leo smirked. "We pushed past our limits. While I kept him distracted, Lysinas pierced his heart."

"As expected of Lady Lysinas!" Rodia clasped her hands together, her eyes sparkling.

"It's the same now. While I draw his attention, the others will attack."

"Do you think Jörmungandr will simply focus on you alone?"

"I'll make sure he does. It's true that among all the legion commanders, he possesses overwhelming strength. But do you know why he never played a pivotal role in Tartaros?"

"...I never really thought about it."

"Because he's an idiot."

"...What?"

For a moment, Rodia was dumbfounded. Every legion commander she had encountered so far had not only immense power but also cunning to match. That was what made them terrifying.

And yet, the King of Gluttony, said to be the strongest legion commander, was just a dumb brute?

"If he had even half the intelligence of the Lich King, the world would have already been destroyed. The moment I insult Erebos, he'll lose his mind and target only me."

"Alright. I understand the plan. Sir Kyle will draw Jörmungandr's attention to create an opening. But can you endure his focused attacks with your current strength?"

"I can. That's why I formed a pact with Albus." Leo showed her the contract sigil on the back of his hand. "His recklessness is a terrible disaster in itself, but it can also be his greatest weakness."

Leo's grey eyes gleamed. "I'll create the opportunity."

Without hesitation, he declared that he would take on the most dangerous role.

"You all just have to pierce that wide-open heart of his."

*Kugugugugu—!*

Suddenly, the ground shook violently, as if an earthquake had struck.

"W-What?"

"Something's coming!"

Just as the expedition members panicked, a colossal figure rose from a distance beyond the campsite.

*Kwagagagagagagang—!*

A massive serpent.

[Kuoohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!]

A chilling roar erupted from its gaping maw, piercing the sky.

"Jörmungandr!"

{sep}

"What the hell?"

"It really showed up!"

"Everyone, prepare for battle! Prepare for battle!"

At Jörmungandr's appearance, the expedition fell into chaos. 

They hastily formed ranks and prepared for combat. The knights and warriors gripped their weapons. The mages chanted their spells, and the summoners called forth their spirit beasts.

Up until this very moment, most of the expedition had been skeptical about Leo's claim that they would face Jörmungandr. So when Jörmungandr appeared, fear gripped them all.

However, though they were afraid, they did not cower. They were seasoned warriors who had survived the Age of Calamity and defended Godthrone for many years. Though history would never remember their names, they were heroes who laid the foundation for the Age of Heroes.

Even in fear, they did not neglect their duty.

Amidst it all, the ones most shocked were Leo and Rodia, who had been certain of Jörmungandr's location.

"This is way off from the original battlefield!" Rodia spoke urgently.

Leo clicked his tongue. "Just because that's how history happened doesn't mean it has to play out exactly the same in the Hero Record! Unexpected situations can always arise!"

"But... this deviation is way too big!"

"It doesn't change anything. Get ready for battle!"

At Leo's words, Rodia also took formation with the expedition. 

Meanwhile, Lysinas rushed over. "Kyle! You were right!"

"Yeah." Leo clenched and unclenched his fist.

As the formation was being completed, Allox spoke up. "I'll take the vanguard alongside Kyle and Arlene!"

"No." Leo shook his head. "I'll hold him off alone. Allox, Arlene, you two focus on attacking his openings."

"What?" Allox's expression darkened. "Kyle! No matter how strong you are, this is reckless! Holding him off alone?!"

"Allox is right! Kyle! What the hell are you thinking?!" Lysinas grabbed Leo's sleeve, her face deathly pale.

"There's no one in this expedition who can match my mobility. I made a pact with the King of Pegasus." Leo looked at Jörmungandr. "That monster can't be killed with just any ordinary attack. Unless all of you go all-out, you won't be able to land a fatal blow."

"But stopping Jörmungandr alone is nearly impossible."

"Unfortunately, from now on, we'll have to do the impossible."

"What?"

Leo turned to the expedition. "If we're going to save the world, we have to make the impossible possible."

Everyone was left speechless.

"And slaying that damn snake right here is the first step to saving the world." Leo spoke with unwavering seriousness. "Don't worry about me. I am the Surviving Hero. Even if everyone here dies, I'll be the last one standing."

"That's a shitty thing to say," Perique muttered, letting out a dry chuckle. "Can you really hold him off?"

"Yeah."

"Then I'll leave the front to you."

"If you even start to waver, I'll jump in immediately."

"Good luck, Kyle."

Allox and Arlene patted Leo's shoulder.

"Everyone, take your positions!" Rodia commanded.

The heroes moved swiftly.

In the midst of it all, Leo looked at Lysinas, who was still clutching his sleeve. He gently removed her hand. "Don't worry too much. This battle is only the beginning of a grand journey."

At Leo's words, Lysinas gave a heavy nod.

*Kugugugugung—!*

[Filthy worms crawling out of Godthrone!]

Jörmungandr slithered across the ground, sneering at the distant presences he sensed.

[I smell dragons. Their flesh is a delicacy!]

*Sniff sniff—*

Flicking his tongue, he followed the ominous scent that had lured him here. As befitting the King of Gluttony, his ravenous appetite surged. And then, he spotted someone flying toward him.

[Hmph, a mere insect dares approach me alone...]

Jörmungandr sneered at the foolish human—only for his body to freeze in an instant.

The wind carried it to him.

The stench of ominous blood.

It was not a literal scent. It was something deeply ingrained in the soul of the human flying toward him.

*What... is this stench?*

It was unbearable, something he instinctively wanted to avoid.

*Kugugugugung—!*

The ground trembled.

No, it was Jörmungandr's own body that was shaking.

*What is this... this fear?*

His instincts screamed at him, despite the fact that he was the strongest of all legion commanders. 

He was feeling an indescribable terror toward a mere human. A scent hidden beneath the smell of Erebos.

*Blood? My own blood?*

The primal fear of facing the human before him made the strongest legion commander feel utterly insignificant. 

But before that, overwhelming hatred drowned out everything else.

*Impossible!*

His senses, capable of perceiving even the scent of souls, told him the truth. That human had not only slain him but had also killed the great god he worshiped. 

A being whose very existence was a blasphemy against everything he stood for.

Like a beast in a frenzy, Jörmungandr thrashed about. Primal fear and hatred obliterated his rationality.

[Kieeeeeeeeeeeek!]

Jörmungandr rolled his eyes back and let out a wailing roar toward the sky.

"It's been a while, Jörmungandr," Leo said, reaching him.

[Godslayer! I do not know of such a filthy existence as you!]

A thick killing intent radiated from Leo's body. "I'm sure you don't, but I know you. Still, Godslayer, huh? I've never killed a god, though."

[Silence! You could never reach the gods! Today, here and now! Your existence will be erased!]

Jörmungandr, his mind clouded with rage, spewed out a string of hate-filled curses.

Leo narrowed his eyes. 

*This bastard... for some reason, he knows what I did in the future.*

His gaze sharpened. 

*But that doesn't change anything.* 

The fact remained that he had to defeat Jörmungandr here and now.

*Wuuung—!*

Leo unleashed his spiritual energy. Pure white lightning roared into existence.

*Pazzzzzzt! Flash—!*

Summoning Albus, Leo mounted her and pulled on the reins formed from spiritual energy. "Albus, take off."

*Kwagagagagang—!*

At that moment, Jörmungandr's breath of destruction came crashing down, but Leo was no longer there. 

Jörmungandr's six eyes turned to the distant sky.

[...So it finally begins.] Albus murmured as she looked down at Jörmungandr.

"Yeah. Time to put down that overgrown worm." Leo gently stroked Albus's mane. "Forgive me if I'm a bit rough with you in our first battle, my lady."

[Kyle, just make sure you don't get overwhelmed by my power.]

Leo smiled faintly at her words.

[But you said your goal was to hold off that wretched creature alone, didn't you? Can you really manage it?]

"I can... but since that thing's already lost its mind, I might have to use my trump card a bit earlier than expected."

[A trump card? You had another trump card besides me?]

Albus's voice carried a hint of petulance, making Leo chuckle. "Yeah. I was going to summon them later to avoid suspicion."

[Suspicion?]

Leo spread his arms wide.

*Wuuung—!*

Spiritual energy surged around the backs of his hands. Golden and black contract sigils emerged.

Albus's eyes widened in disbelief. [This power...! Kyle, just what *are* you? How did you...?!]

"My identity, huh..." Leo laughed as he forcibly invoked his hidden summon contracts. "People do call me this sometimes."

A summoning circle appeared.

"The Hero of the Beginning."

Leo shouted, "Elsie! Sylord!"

At his call, his contracted summons revealed themselves.
