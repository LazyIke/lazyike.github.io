Leo studied Darian, who sat across from him.

Darian met his gaze and spoke. "I'll get straight to the point. There's a high chance that the legacy of the Dawn Dragon, Rodia, lies dormant beneath the Casino of Shadows."

Beside Leo, Aru's eyes widened. "How can you be so sure? Have you seen it yourself?"

"I've spent years researching this country as a hero scholar."

A *hero scholar*—a researcher who specialized in the study of heroes, tracking their relics and uncovering their lost history.

Their work spanned various fields. Some traced the artifacts of heroes whose Hero Records existed but whose relics had yet to be discovered, making it impossible to open their Hero Worlds. Others sought out ruins of long-forgotten nations, searching for traces of heroes within them. Some focused on recovering lost Hero Records.

And in the process, some ended up exploring Hero Dungeons.

Most hero scholars came from hero academies, having studied heroics in depth.

"Few hero scholars pay attention to Aleham," Darian continued. "Even though it's a nation with a long history and has produced many heroes."

"That's because all records and ruins related to Aleham's heroes have been found outside its current borders," Aru said flatly.

It was true. The traces of Aleham's past heroes were all located in what used to be Aleham's territory—land that had long since become independent and was now home to other hero clans.

"Exactly," Darian nodded. "And on top of that, Aleham hasn't produced a hero in centuries."

The heroes of the past had lost all connection to Aleham.

And for the last few hundred years, not a single new hero had emerged from this land.

To most hero scholars, Aleham was simply not worth researching.

"But this is the nation where the Dawn Dragon, Rodia, was born. That alone makes it invaluable for study."

"The research on the Heroes of Dawn should be long finished," Leo said. "Over three thousand years of study has uncovered most of their legacies."

"That's true. The Twilight Knight Lumene, the Comet Mage Seiren, the Grand Warrior Azonia, and the Unyielding Damien—all of their legacies have been passed down through the hero academies. Even I have inherited a small part of Lumene's legacy."

The Heroes of Dawn' legacy consisted of their teachings, their Hero Records, and their *relics*. Since the Hero Worlds of Trailblazing themselves no longer existed, true succession was impossible.

"But," Darian continued, a knowing smile on his lips, "you must have noticed, right? Every one of the Heroes of Dawn left behind something related to the Great Hero—except Rodia. He left behind nothing related to Lysinas."

His smile deepened.

"Isn't that strange? Rodia was a symbol of that era too. It was because of him that the hero academies were founded."

The Twilight Knight, the Comet Mage, the Grand Warrior, and the Unyielding were the ones who established the hero academies. But it was Rodia who first proposed the idea of nurturing future heroes through formal institutions.

All four left behind their legacies for future generations.

Except Rodia.

He had left something behind for the dragons, but compared to his comrades, it was lacking.

"Wouldn't it make sense," Darian mused, "that he left something behind, meant for someone worthy of inheriting it? I've long believed so, which is why I've dedicated my life to studying everything related to the Heroes of Dawn. Eventually, I came to the conclusion that Rodia's legacy must be hidden here, in his homeland. And the labyrinth beneath the Casino of Shadows is the only place in this country that I haven't been able to study."

His deduction was correct.

Rodia had, in fact, left behind a treasury in this place—meant for the one who would become Laurel's Oathbearer.

There was even a legend that a library of Laurel might be hidden here.

Leo spoke. "Why are you telling us this?"

If Darian truly believed that Rodia's legacy was in the underground labyrinth, then logically, he should be trying to claim it for himself. That would be the best way to secure its power.

Yet he was offering a partnership.

Of course, Leo already knew what lay in the treasury.

But that was only because he had sworn an oath to Laurel.

"Unfortunately," Darian admitted, "while I've confirmed the existence of the labyrinth beneath the Casino of Shadows, I haven't been able to enter it."

"If a Lumene graduate failed to conquer it, what could a second-year like me possibly do?"

"You're being awfully modest, youngest student council president of Lumene," Darian said with a smirk before his expression turned serious.

"To be precise, I never even got the chance to attempt it. The master of the Casino of Shadows didn't permit me entry."

"Then wouldn't I be just as out of luck?" Leo asked.

"Normally, yes. But I've heard that the master *does* allow those who catch her interest to enter. You should be able to earn her favor. You need a hundred million points for a meeting, right? I can cover that cost for you. What do you say?"

*You're offering that kind of money so easily? To someone you barely know?*

Leo smiled. "I appreciate the offer, but I'll have to decline."

"And why is that?"

"I'm not a fan of excessive generosity."

Darian narrowed his eyes. "Hoh... Refusing excessive generosity is one thing, but telling the benefactor outright is foolish. Is that inexperience talking?"

"You said you've been studying in this country for years," Leo said.

"That's right."

"Then that means you're affiliated with the Aleham royal family."

Darian froze.

"You already know why Lumene students came to Aleham, don't you? Whether we get along or not, we were never going to be allies in the first place."

Leo rose from his seat, shrugging.

Darian chuckled. "As your senior, let me give you some advice. There's nothing here that Lumene is looking for. Stop wasting your time and accept my offer. Consider it my last act of generosity. As student council president, wouldn't it be better for you to walk away with some results?"

"Whether this is a waste of time or not, I'll decide once I finish my investigation. And I don't need to work with you to explore the labyrinth."

"Hah... The youngest student council president really *is* arrogant," Darian sneered. "Know your place. You're just a second-year. From my perspective, you're nothing more than a wet-behind-the-ears brat. If it were Hark Rigard or Elena Zeron, they would have accepted my proposal without hesitation."

*Elena would've attacked him on the spot, and Hark... Hark would've ignored him and gone back to sleep.*

Leo knew his seniors well.

Whatever the reason, those two came from Lumene's Three Great Clans.

They would never compromise with someone who opposed Lumene's interests.

Darian had completely miscalculated.

Clicking his tongue, Leo gestured for Aru to follow and left.

"He suddenly got all high and mighty," Aru muttered. "And his eyes... they looked kinda off."

Leo narrowed his gaze.

*I know that kind of look.*

The eyes of someone willing to do anything to achieve their goal.

And Leo knew exactly how far that kind of person was willing to go.

He touched his temple.

*Fwoom—!*

A faint ripple of mana spread.

[This is the first time you've contacted me like this.]

A surprised voice echoed in Leo's ear—Chen Xia.

She was using the artifact device she had given him.

Although she dreamed of becoming a hero, Chen Xia had never denied her identity as a Shadow.

What most students didn't know was that after Leo had saved her, she had chosen to follow him as a Shadow.

And there was only one reason to use the artifact.

[Give me an order, master.]

"Drop the title. It makes me sound weird."

[But I like it.]

Leo sighed as her amused voice rang in his ear.

[What do you need me to do, Master Leo?]

"Can you come to the Casino of Shadows in Wargella?"

[On my way.]

After the transmission ended, Leo turned to Aru. "Aside from you, how many Azonia students have gambling debts here?"

"Including me? Seventeen."

Leo clicked his tongue. "Can you all pay it off?"

"Don't worry! We'll be free next week!"

Hands on her hips, Aru puffed out her chest proudly.

Leo sighed. *I hope our students aren't as dumb as the ones from Azonia.*

"What's your plan for paying it back?"

Aru grinned. "The arena."

"So." Chelsea pressed her fingers against her temple. "You lost *all* your points?"

"If only I knew the class prez's three sizes, I could've made a hundred million points," Eliana said with a perfectly serious expression.

Chelsea stared at her for a moment before deadpanning, "Idiot."

"Ugh." Eliana flinched, unable to argue. "At least I didn't go into debt!"

"You drained the underclassmen's points dry. If you'd *still* ended up in debt, you wouldn't just be an idiot—you'd be a complete fool," Chelsea said coldly.

Eliana averted her eyes, feigning innocence.

"It's not just Eliana's fault," Chloe sighed. "Most of us lost money too."

Carl flicked a chip into the air.

*Ding!*

The crisp sound rang out before he caught it mid-spin, a smug grin on his face. "I won."

"How much?"

"A thousand points."

Chelsea sighed. "Not bad, but nowhere near enough."

"Seems like events are the only way to make real money," Juen muttered.

"Anyway, when is Leo getting here?"

It was already past the appointed time, yet there was no sign of him. Everyone exchanged puzzled looks.

Just then—

[Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to another thrilling night at the Casino of Shadows!]

A booming voice, amplified by magic, echoed throughout the casino.

Every gaze turned toward the center of the floor.

With a metallic *clank*, the ground split apart, and from the ceiling, an iron cage descended.

[Welcome once again to the grand stage of honorable bloodshed!]

Cheers erupted from all around.

The group watched in shock as the iron bars locked into place, forming an arena. The structure ensured that once inside, escape was impossible.

*Fwoosh—!*

The casino lights dimmed, and a single spotlight illuminated the center of the ring.

Then, the spectators murmured as they took in the sight of the lone figure standing there.

"Oh my, such a young boy is the first challenger?"

"Ah, how tragic. I wonder what his story is."

Well-dressed noblewomen spoke with feigned sympathy, but their eyes gleamed with anticipation.

They had no doubt the boy would soon be screaming in agony.

[Our first challenger has boldly declared his goal—to defeat the Champion! Now, can he fight his way to the top? Let the first match begin!]

At the announcer's cue, a group of bunny girls emerged.

[The challenger's first opponent—garbage from the slums! The man who brutally murdered seven boys and girls! Introducing... Jaydon!]

"Gwoooaaaahhh!"

A hulking figure with a mask covering his face let out a guttural roar, brandishing an enormous sword.

"How revolting. A murderer?"

"They're giving trash like him another chance to live?"

People clicked their tongues in disgust, but none stopped placing their bets.

The bell signaling the end of betting rang.

Then, a horn blared, marking the start of the match.

All eyes turned to the arena.

Jaydon sneered, his expression twisted. "How should I cut you up, brat?"

Leo met his gaze, his voice calm. "Do you want to die painlessly? Or do you want to suffer first?"

"You arrogant little—!"

Jaydon raised his massive sword and lunged.

*Crunch—!*

The moment Jaydon swung—

*Snap! Crack!*

"Guuaaaaghhh!"

His arm bent at an unnatural angle.

Leo had grabbed his wrist and twisted.

Jaydon collapsed to one knee, screaming in agony.

Leo kicked him in the leg.

*Crack!*

His knee snapped.

As Jaydon howled in pain, Leo grabbed him by the collar and flung him aside like discarded trash.

*Thud!*

Jaydon's massive body hit the ground with a dull impact, rolling lifelessly.

Writhing in agony, he gasped for breath as life slowly drained from his body.

The entire audience was stunned into silence.

Even Leo's friends were among those frozen in shock.

*If I were using a blade, the impact might have been even worse.*

Leo cracked his fingers without looking toward them.

To his friends, who had only seen him in a positive light, this side of him must have been a brutal revelation.

*But I can't always show them the good parts.*

He let out a dry chuckle.

*My way isn't necessarily the right way. But knowing how to deal with filth isn't a bad thing either.*
