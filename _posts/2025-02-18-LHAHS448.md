Two Great Heroes and one hero, along with six hero candidates, charged toward Erebos.

Leading at the front, Aaron ran through the sky.

"He's insanely fast," Torua marveled, riding her staff.

Lunia, seated in front of her, said, "Well, of course. It's Aaron. But why do I have to ride on your staff?"

"We had no choice, did we? Your friend is moving with our school's summoning department junior, and Raynia is flying with Ulta."

"That's not what I meant. I'm saying I can move just fine without your help..."

"You wouldn't be able to keep up, would you? You're a firepower idiot, specialized only in firepower."

"A firepower idiot?! I can use plenty of other magic just fine!"

"Yeah, but not as well as I can, right?"

"Urgh..." Lunia clenched her fists and faced forward in frustration.

Seeing that, Torua smirked and blew a breath into her ear. "Whoo..."

Lunia covered her ears, her face turning bright red. "W-What are you doing?!"

"You seemed nervous."

"I wasn't!"

Torua chuckled. "Seems like you really want to be useful. Just focus on attacking. Aaron must have chosen you for this party for that reason."

"...Yes." As she answered, Lunia glanced at Leo in the lead, her expression tinged with frustration.

*Am I still not able to stand beside them?*

She knew the answer. It wasn't just her—Eiran and Eliza felt the same way.

*Aside from Leo, we second-years are still too lacking to be part of this party.*

Even Torua, Ulta, and Raynia weren't enough to stand alongside Aaron and Melina. But at least, as graduates, they could provide support.

For Lunia, Eiran, and Eliza, however, the reason Aaron had chosen them was because of a single spell.

{sep}

"You really completed Flame Emperor? That's amazing! If Luna had known, she would've been so happy."

During the training camp, when Lunia mentioned that she had completed the Stellar Magic Flame Emperor, Aaron had been genuinely moved. Lunia was bewildered—was this really something to be so emotional about?

"Wasn't Flame Emperor the spell Luna created to counter Erebos's flames?"

"That's right."

Luna had left behind an unfinished spell—Flame Emperor. Though Lunia had completed it, she didn't actually know much about it. All she knew was that the spell had been recorded in Luna's grimoire stored in the Xian Empire, that Leo had taught her the formula, and that Luna had never managed to complete it in her lifetime.

Lunia also understood what Luna's undying white flames were meant to represent. Thinking that Luna had failed to realize her goal, Lunia had resolved to complete the spell.

"Didn't she create this spell to defeat Erebos?"

"Yes. But that wasn't the only meaning behind it."

"What do you mean?"

"There were five spells Luna poured special feelings into creating."

At Aaron's words, Lunia and Eiran perked up their ears. No matter what anyone said, Luna was the most respected and beloved figure among the elves—their great Nebula Pioneer. Hearing about her directly from Aaron, her companion and friend, naturally drew their full attention.

"The first is the Magic of Blooming Flowers. That spell contained everything Luna was, and it was the one she was most proud of."

"I know that one." Lunia said. 

Eiran nodded. "It's the pinnacle of Stellar Magic." 

"The second is Stellar Radius."

"Ah..."

"The spell that defeated Zodiac."

"That spell is Luna herself. She made it while thinking of herself, shining as brightly as a star."

A spell unique to Luna, an explosion of brilliant starlight. Not even Leo's Bible could fully capture the essence of that magic—Luna's ultimate symbol.

"The third is Extinction."

A spell still renowned as one of the strongest in the world.

"Luna had a personality that wouldn't let her rest until she completely obliterated anything that stood in her way, so she created..."

"Aaron, you don't need to finish that sentence."

Lunia hastily interrupted. She didn't want her imagined version of Luna to be ruined any further.

But others reacted differently.

"Ooh! So she had the same terrible personality as this nasty elf?"

"Do you want to die, stupid cat?!"

As things grew rowdy, Aaron laughed cheerfully.

"You seem to be enjoying yourself," Drianna noted.

Aaron nodded. "It just makes me wonder if people looked at us the same way back then."

At that, everyone except Leo widened their eyes.

"Were the Great Heroes like this too?"

"No way."

"Doesn't seem likely."

Lunia, Aru, and Drianna whispered among themselves.

"Sounds like fun," Carl said, clasping his hands behind his head.

"It was fun." Aaron smiled wistfully.

Eiran, eyes gleaming with excitement, asked, "What was the fourth spell filled with special meaning?"

"It was called Innocence."

"Innocence?"

"Wasn't that the spell Kyle used?"

At Aaron's words, everyone recalled the brief moment they had met Kyle in Dweno's world.

"Yeah. Luna made that spell for Kyle."

"It was such a beautiful spell." Lunia smiled brightly.

As Aaron spoke, Leo recalled the past.

> "Ahem! Kyle."
>
> "What?"
>
> "Come sit down. I made a spell just for you."
>
> "It's probably another useless spell. I don't need it."
>
> "What's wrong with the Magic of Blooming Flowers?!" Luna bared her fangs and growled.
>
> Kyle sighed and sat down in front of her. "What kind of spell is it?"
>
> "I made it using your mana attribute. It's called Innocence."
>
> "Didn't you say innocence and I don't match at all?"
>
> "Yeah, you don't. But Dweno once said that in some ways, you're so innocent it's stupid. That's what gave me the idea."
>
> "Do you want to experience firsthand what it's like to be beaten by a stupidly innocent guy, you damn elf?"
>
> "Mmrmph!"
>
> Kyle grabbed Luna's cheeks and pulled them sideways. Luna flailed, trying to retaliate, but Kyle's arms were much longer, so she could only squirm helplessly.

As Leo recalled that moment, he let out a bitter smile. Aaron must have remembered it too because he burst into laughter.

Then, Eiran asked with sparkling eyes, "But... if Luna put special feelings into making that spell for Kyle... does that mean she had feelings for him?"

Holding her flushed cheeks, ears twitching with excitement, she could barely contain herself.

"You sure have a wild imagination, Eiran."

"Seriously." Lunia and Aru chuckled.

Hearing that, Drianna remarked, "Compared to you two with your awful personalities, Eiran seems the most maiden-like."

Lunia and Aru immediately narrowed their eyes.

Carl clicked his tongue. "You do realize you're the same age as them? You're the weirdest one, you pervert."

As the four of them bickered, Aaron shook his head. "Luna didn't have feelings for Kyle. They fought all the time."

"I see."

"Really just like us."

Everyone nodded knowingly, while Eiran, disappointed, drooped her ears.

"So the fifth spell must be Flame Emperor?" Lunia asked,

"Yeah." Aaron nodded. "Flame Emperor was developed to counter Erebos's black flames."

"To counter them?"

"Yeah. Since Dweno and I fought on the front lines, she made it to protect us." Aaron smiled bitterly. "She said she couldn't stand losing even one of us."

Yet in the end, the spell remained unfinished.

Leo sighed quietly. 

*If Flame Emperor had been completed, maybe things would have turned out differently.*

He recalled Luna's desperate wails and self-blame over Aaron and Dweno's deaths.

For Aaron, it was a relief.

*Aaron would have broken if he had seen Luna's grief.*

Hearing Aaron's words, Lunia's expression turned solemn. She had never imagined that the spell passed down to her after 5,000 years had been created with such deep emotions.

{sep}

Now, Lunia understood.

*I have to fulfill Luna's will.*

Aaron had fallen first. Then, Dweno followed. And third, Luna went after her friends.

Lunia couldn't even begin to imagine what Luna must have felt at that moment.

*Even if I'm lacking... I have to protect everyone with Luna's magic.*

Lunia steeled herself.

Meanwhile, they had already closed the distance to Erebos.

*Fwoooosh—!*

Flames erupted from Erebos's body.

*Flash—!*

Aaron stepped forward with force. Golden aura wrapped around his entire body as he transformed.

"Groooooooar!"

Aaron's howl resounded once more. The powerful Howling filled his party's hearts with courage.

Aaron drew his sword, golden aura condensing at its tip. Becoming a golden streak of light, he dashed toward Erebos.

*Whooosh—!*

"Guooooooo!"

The Brave Hero's blade cleaved through Erebos's chest.

Landing on the ground, Aaron's eyes sharpened. "Melina!"

At Aaron's call, Melina grabbed Leo's hand and soared high into the sky. Once they reached the height they needed, Melina brought her hands together.

*Vwooom—!*

A massive magic circle formed. The overwhelming amount of mana distorted the air around them.

"That's an insane amount of mana... What kind of spell is that?" Lunia asked while preparing to attack.

Torua, in the middle of chanting, glanced at the sky and answered, "Disaster. The Dawn Dragon Rodia's signature spell."

A grand spell that ruled over nature.

*Whoooosh—! Kraaah—!*

A massive storm engulfed Erebos.

Watching, Eliza murmured, "It's a perfect superior version of Abad's Tempest."

"Of course. While Abad's Tempest creates natural disasters, this spell controls them."

A spell that literally belonged to the highest tier of natural magic.

*Kraaah—!*

[Groooooar!]

Erebos thrashed against the immense storm. But while Disaster could restrain him, it couldn't deal significant damage.

Melina smiled as she observed.

*That's fine. This is enough.*

Her role was merely to keep Erebos pinned in place.

"Leo." Melina called out to Leo. "Lysinas's magic."

Leo raised his hand. "Laruel."

*Flash—!*

In his grasp, the Great Spirit of Light, Laruel, was summoned. As Leo channeled his spiritual energy, the Spirit of Radiance transformed into a bow of light—just as the Spirit of Brilliance had done long ago.

Leo took hold of the bow and drew its string.

*Vwooom—!*

A single arrow formed at the nock. 

Seeing this, Melina beamed. *Long ago, the Wise Queen banished all that was evil and impure with this light.*

Leo spoke its name, "Judgment."

*Flash—! Booooooom—!*

The arrow of light struck Erebos, triggering an enormous explosion.

*Kaaaaa-boom—!*

The storm that had restrained Erebos vanished without a trace. A massive crater remained, with black magma scattered across the land.

Leo narrowed his eyes at the overwhelming power. Yet, neither he, Aaron, nor even Melina could fully comprehend the situation.

"This seems... too weak," Melina muttered.

Leo clicked his tongue. "I see."

"Pardon?"

"The seal on it has been broken, but its consciousness hasn't fully awakened yet. Right now, it's just wielding power on instinct."

"Which means..." Melina's face stiffened.

"Yeah. This hasn't even started yet."

The magma began to stir, forming into the shape of Erebos's face.

As Aaron raised his sword in response...

*Flash—!*

Erebos's eyes snapped open.

The moment their gazes met, Aaron's expression hardened.

[Heheheheheh.] A low chuckle escaped Erebos's mouth. [Is this another one of the gods' pathetic little miracles?]

*Gwoooosh—!*

The atmosphere shifted in an instant.

*Fwoooosh—!*

Erebos's body erupted into flames once more.

*Rumble—!*

The pressure he exuded was incomparable to before. He sneered at Aaron.

[Are you prepared to watch the world burn again, specter of the past?]
