Assistant Professor Anna could only stare in speechless disbelief at the bizarre magic formula Len had devised.

*This man... He really is a genius.*

Though he had an unfortunate tendency to be eccentric, it was impossible not to admire him as a mage. Even Anna, who had a deep knowledge of magic, felt overwhelmed just looking at the magic formula Len had composed.

Indeed, he was genuinely delighted.

*Fufufu! This will make for an interesting lesson.*

His passion and sense of responsibility as a professor of magic were tremendous. For the past few days, Len had immersed himself in researching magic formulas, eagerly anticipating the return of students from their field training. 

Finally, today, the students had mostly returned, and classes resumed.

Watching Len proudly present his magic formula to the students, Anna found herself smiling without realizing it.

And then...

"I think there's an error in the formula, Professor."

At the words of the Seiren exchange student, Anna felt a wave of dizziness.

Len's eyes practically gleamed as he turned toward Luna, who had raised her hand. "Are you the exchange student from Seiren?"

"Yes, I am."

"I see. And how exactly is this formula incorrect?"

"I believe the approach taken in the first step of solving the formula is flawed!"

Anna screamed internally.

The other students murmured among themselves, their gazes flickering between Len and Luna.

For a mage, their magic formula was a matter of pride. Of course, new ideas and approaches were always welcome, but this particular magic formula was an original creation by Len. To claim that the initial approach was flawed was essentially an attack on his pride as a mage.

"The first step's approach is flawed? Interesting." Len curled his lips into a smirk. "Exchange student, what's your name?"

"My name is Lu."

"Does anyone else agree with Lu's opinion?"

Chloe cautiously raised her hand. "I also think there's a mistake in the approach."

*Clap— Clap— Clap—*

"Excellent. Simply excellent." Len clapped his hands in satisfaction.

Assistant Professor Anna, who had expected him to have one of his episodes, let out a sigh of relief—though she was also puzzled.

"This is the first version of the magic formula I originally devised. It has since been refined multiple times, but as you all know, creating new magic doesn't happen overnight. It's possible that the modifications I made will end up being useless. That's why I wanted to discuss this initial formula with you and go through the process of refining it together. Collective intelligence is important, after all. You might notice things I've overlooked."

Upon hearing Len's words, Luna clapped enthusiastically. Seeing Luna's fervor, the other students hesitated before clapping along as well. 

Amused by their reaction, Len let out a small chuckle, "Lu, you have an excellent attitude in class."

As he nodded in satisfaction, Luna turned to Leo and said, "This school's magic lessons are amazing. That Professor Len guy is a proper teacher."

"You look like you're having fun."

"Of course I am! Just by looking at that formula, I can tell how much magic has advanced in this era!" Luna's eyes sparkled. "You noticed the mistake in the formula's approach too, didn't you?"

"Yeah."

Since Luna had once taught Leo magic, she was well aware of his level.

"That Chloe girl is impressive, too. She's still young."

"She's a mage with a promising future."

"Good. It's wonderful to see kids with a bright future ahead of them."

Luna propped her chin on her hand and scanned the lecture hall. Leo and Luna had taken seats at the very back.

"You get to see this every day. How does it feel to watch these kids grow and improve?"

"It's reassuring."

"I bet."

Luna gazed at the students who would one day lead the history of magic with a gentle smile.

"This is really nice."

That strangely wistful smile made Leo fall silent.

After class ended, Leo and Luna remained in the lecture hall, waiting for the students to leave. Eiran had already gone with Chloe, as she had plans to have lunch with Chen Xia.

As he tidied up the lecture hall, Len smiled at them. "Hm? Leo, Lu. Do you have any questions?"

Luna nodded. "Yes, I have some questions about the magic formula you showed us in today's lesson, Professor Len."

"Elves usually aren't interested in anything other than Stellar Magic! Your passion for magic is impressive!" Len nodded approvingly.

"I was also really impressed by your passion for magic, Professor Len. Everything you talked about today was truly creative."

"It's always nice to meet a student who speaks my language. You're from the lower class, right? Seiren must be completely blind to your worth. How about quitting and transferring to our school?"

The two of them had a lively exchange.

"So, what are you curious about?"

"The magic formula you devised—it's meant to be a spell for traveling to the future, isn't it?"

Len's shoulders flinched. "How did you...?"

Up until now, he had only told the students that today's magic formula was themed around time. He hadn't even mentioned his true objective to Assistant Professor Anna. He believed that part of the learning process was deducing the final goal of the formula while studying it.

That was why he hadn't expected anyone to pinpoint his intention in the very first lesson.

"Actually, I had a similar thought recently."

"A similar thought?"

"I was thinking it'd be nice if there was a spell to travel to the past."

"And why did you think that?"

"Because I want to fix one of my past mistakes."

Luna wanted to go back and smack the version of herself who had confessed to Leo in the Hero World.

... A completely absurd reason.

"I devised this formula because I wanted to see my future self."

Len was curious about how he would be praised as a great figure in the world of magic.

Both of them had thoroughly self-centered and petty reasons, but that was how magic worked.

Great transformations could stem from trivial motives.

That was the essence of magic.

Of course, the possibility of successfully creating a time-travel spell was close to zero. Even so, the idea itself was not wrong.

*Because that's how magical progress is made.*

"After seeing your formula, I thought it would be interesting to compare it with the one I devised and discuss it together."

"Oh?" Len let out a sound of admiration. He then looked at Luna with a pleased expression. "Could you show me?"

Luna nodded at his request and stepped in front of the large lecture hall's chalkboard.

Then, she casually snapped her fingers.

*Snap—!*

The chalk on the blackboard instantly crumbled into dust. The fine chalk powder gathered in the air like smoke and then formed magic formulas on the board.

Anna's jaw dropped open at the sight. 

Len, too, was utterly mesmerized by the formulas that had appeared before him.

*Is this... a work of art?*

Len's body trembled. The magic formula drawn on the board looked like something from ancient texts. It was not in line with modern trends. But that only made it more valuable—it had a depth that seemed limitless.

*Where have I felt this before?*

Len's gaze shifted to Leo.

*Yes, I felt it when I first met Leo.*

Leo's existence had been a shock to Len. He believed that Leo was the very future of the magical world. But the elf student standing before him had surpassed even that.

*Just what is this elf student?*

Len had seen countless magical talents. He even considered himself one of the geniuses. But today, his perspective changed. The elf girl before him was, quite literally, on a different level.

Anna was certain that Len would have a fit. But Len remained composed.

"What kind of feedback are you looking for?"

"Are there any areas that need improvement or corrections?"

"Hmm." Len crossed his arms and studied the magic formula. Then, he finally said, "It might be better to adjust the rune script in the middle. Rather than simply directing the mana flow backward, it should spiral in reverse. After all, the concept of time transcends dimensions."

"Aha!" Luna clapped her hands together. "That makes perfect sense!"

After that, Luna and Len continued their discussion about magic. 

As he watched Luna accept his suggestions and refine the formula even further, Len was filled with admiration.

*To possess such talent and skill yet still be open to others' opinions! Isn't this the ideal of what a mage should be?!*

"Leo, what do you think?"

"It's impressive."

"Right?" Luna smiled happily.

Seeing her like that, Leo smiled.

Luna Luminance. A mage who loved magic more than anything. An elf who found the greatest joy in exploring, researching, and pursuing the truth of magic.

For Luna, studying magic was happiness itself. 

That was why, when it came to magic, Leo wanted to let her do whatever she wanted.

As he watched the two of them talk, Len suddenly looked up at the ceiling and burst into laughter.

"Fufufu. Fuhahahaha!"

Anna's face tensed in alarm at his sudden outburst.

"Assistant Professor Anna, just now, I felt my destiny. I realized what my greatest achievement in the magical world should be."

*Here it comes...*

Anna braced herself, expecting another one of Len's fits.

"Students, could you both come sit at the front of the classroom?"

Leo and Luna exchanged puzzled looks but took their seats as instructed.

Anna stared at Len with an expression that clearly asked, 'What nonsense are you up to now?'

"Today, I realized that you two require a special lesson."

"A special lesson?"

"Yes."

"What kind of lesson?"

"A lesson on how a man and a woman create a baby."

Luna's expression went blank at the completely unexpected statement.

"This is an important subject for you two, as you will..."

"What the hell are you saying to students, you lunatic?!" Anna, her face burning red, smacked Len's head with the attendance book.

"What do you think you're doing?!"

"I should be asking you that! What do you think you're doing, making students sit down for this kind of nonsense?!"

At Anna's outburst, Len replied firmly. "This is all for the sake of the magical world! Leo and Lu—just imagine a child born from two such geniuses! Would that not be the greatest blessing to the field of magic?!"

"Leo! Lu! Get out of here! Don't listen to this pervert anymore!"

At Anna's words, Leo and Luna promptly left the lecture hall.

"What an amusing professor," Luna chuckled. "I really like this school!"

"I'm glad to hear that. Where do you want to go next?"

Luna grinned. "The library."

*Rooooooar—!*

A massive surge of black mana swirled violently.

*Crack—!*

The ground split open, and a woman emerged.

"It's been a long time, Kineshi."

The Mirror Queen Kineshi, a demon with transparent hair and eyes, gazed at the Lich King.

"Hell Kaiser. What exactly is going on?" she asked her former comrade, her face expressionless.

The Lich King curled his lips into a smirk. "I have revived you using the power of God."
