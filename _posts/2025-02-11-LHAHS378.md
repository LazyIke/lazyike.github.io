"Hoo..." Exhaling a plume of smoke, Kirin, the master of the Casino of Shadows, muttered as she watched the battle unfold through a magic projection, "Interesting."

*Did Rina Flix personally train him?*

Rina Flix.

A former Shadow who had risen to the position of Lumene's headmaster—a figure whose appointment had sparked global controversy. Even now, the debates surrounding her remained ongoing.

The Shadows did not have a favorable reputation. Their duty was to protect the world from the darkness. Some served as bodyguards for heroes, while others hunted down and eliminated traitors.

Most of their work remained hidden, but there were those who made their presence known—those who publicly pursued and ruthlessly executed betrayers. It was these Shadows who had shaped the world's perception of them.

This was why so many feared and misunderstood the Shadows.

Now, a member of the Shadows had become Lumene's headmaster. The demand to replace her was constant.

Of course, Altec Zeron, the chairman of Lumene and the one who had personally appointed Rina, ignored such demands.

The reason Rina was chosen as Lumene's headmaster was simple.

She was strong.

A headmaster was meant to guide students and set an example. But more than that, they needed the strength to protect the school.

Altec Zeron, along with Lumene's longest-serving professors, Harrid and Sedgen, had determined that despite her past as a Shadow, no one was more suited to the role than Rina.

And among the Shadows, her legend was well known. To them, she was a living myth.

Even Kirin, the Shadow Lord of the South, had heard stories about her.

*But given Rina Flix's personality, I doubt she trained him herself.*

Kirin narrowed her eyes as she studied Leo.

*That kind of presence isn't created in a day or two.*

As a fellow Shadow, she could tell. Leo was a natural-born executioner.

*No wonder the princess is so infatuated.*

Chuckling, Kirin rose from her seat.

*It would be rude to keep the Master of Xian waiting any longer.*

Her form faded into the darkness.

"Haaahp!"

With a powerful shout, Borman swung his massive fist toward Leo's face—a devastating blow meant to crush him.

Leo clenched his own fist.

*Boom—!*

The impact of their punches echoed through the arena.

A battle of pure strength, devoid of aura.

To anyone watching, the smaller Leo seemed at a clear disadvantage. Yet he remained unmoved, holding his stance without flinching.

Seeing this, Borman huffed through his nose. "My blood is boiling! Standing your ground without retreating—you truly live up to your reputation as Lumene's strongest!"

Excited, he launched a flurry of punches at Leo.

*Pababababak—!*

Leo blocked every single one, slipping into Borman's guard.

*Thud—!*

"Hngh?!"

Borman staggered from an unexpected shock.

*Fwhap—!*

Leo spun, slamming his heel into Borman's temple.

*Crack—! Boom—!*

The enormous beastman crashed to the ground.

Everyone in the audience froze, eyes wide in disbelief.

*Thud—!*

"Hohoho..."

Borman planted his hands on the ground and pushed himself up. "Incredible...! Truly incredible!"

*I thought he was knocked out. What an absurd level of endurance.*

"Should we stop here? Any further, and there'll be blood," Leo said.

"Stop?" Borman smirked, baring his fangs. "I am a descendant of the Brave Hero! A grand warrior, just like Aaron! A man who walks the path of valor, just like Azonia!"

*Boom, boom—!*

He pounded his chest.

"Aaron once said—wounds will only make me stronger!"

*That's something I said...*

Leo made a sour expression.

Kyle had said those words to warriors who had lost confidence after suffering severe injuries in battle. Somewhere along the way, history had twisted it into Aaron's words.

"This battle with you will surely make me stronger! Haaahp!"

Borman charged.

Leo bent his knees.

*Fwhap—!*

In an instant, he vanished.

Borman came to an abrupt halt.

*Tap—!*

Leo had landed behind him. Casually, he reached out and gave Borman a light push.

*Thud—!*

With a heavy crash, Borman collapsed, unconscious.

"Well done," Leo said indifferently.

Even as a second-year, Borman was an exceptional warrior.

His only mistake was choosing the wrong opponent.

Leo flexed his fingers as he looked down at Borman, who was now being carried away on a stretcher. Then, he turned to the entrance.

Arms crossed, Aru stepped forward.

"Hmph. Prepare yourself, Black Rabbit. Now, the champion of this arena will face you."

Grinning, she exhaled sharply through her nose.

*Come to think of it, I've never actually fought Black Rabbit in hand-to-hand combat. This should be fun.*

Like any Azonia student, Aru relished the thrill of battle.

[Now entering the most beautiful champion in the history of the Casino of Shadows' arena!]

The commentator's excited voice rang out.

The crowd, which had been subdued by Leo's overwhelming presence, erupted into cheers.

"Rabbit! Rabbit! Rabbit!"

The male spectators, in particular, responded with enthusiasm.

"How is that a rabbit? She looks like a cat," Eliana muttered, unimpressed.

"Why is Azonia's representative even here, wearing that outfit and acting as the arena champion?" Chloe asked.

"Maybe she made a deal with the casino?"

"A deal, my ass. She's definitely here because of gambling debt," Carl said with a laugh.

Having conquered Dweno's world alongside Aru, he could easily guess why she was in this situation.

Just as Aru prepared to attack...

[An urgent announcement.]

The commentator's hurried voice interrupted.

[By the master's orders, the arena event will now conclude. We ask for our guests' understanding.]

Groans and irritated complaints erupted from the audience.

"What?"

"Why all of a sudden?"

Leo's group also looked confused.

"Lumene students."

A beastman appeared.

He had given no prior indication of his presence, and the group instinctively tensed.

The beastman turned to them with a polite bow.

"The master has summoned you."

Inside the room, Aru sat with a slightly sullen expression.

Now dressed in her Azonia uniform, she flicked her tail and glanced at Leo before speaking. "Black Rabbit."

"What."

"Fight me when we get out of here."

"Why would I fight when we both know how it'll end?"

Aru clenched her fists. "I can't stand you having all the fun!"

"If you're that upset, I'll play with you," Leo said.

"Play? How?"

Leo reached for a tissue on the table, rolling it tightly into a feather-like shape.

Aru's ears twitched.

*Fwap—!*

Before she realized it, her hand shot out to snatch it.

Leo pulled it away at the last second, and she instinctively clapped her hands together, trying to catch it. Her eyes sparkled for a moment before she froze, her expression shifting.

Realizing she had just played a hunting game on instinct, Aru's face turned red. "Stop treating me like a cat!"

"If you're not a cat, then what are you?"

"I'm a beastman! A *cat* beastman! Not your pet cat!"

"Then just don't fall for it."

"It's *instinct*! Keep teasing me, and I'll bite you!" she huffed, baring her teeth.

Leo smirked at her reaction.

At that moment, someone entered the room.

"You two seem close," the newcomer said.

Aru turned, her eyes widening. "Lumene's knight student, Chen Xia?"

"Nice to meet you, Aru Tune," Chen Xia said with a polite smile, pressing her left fist against her right palm in an Eastern greeting.

"Nice to meet you," Aru responded with a grin.

However, her ears twitched as she noticed the person standing behind Chen Xia—Kirin.

Aru's fur bristled. Not out of wariness toward Kirin herself, but because the scent of blood clinging to her triggered her beastman instincts.

"Aru Tune," Kirin said. "As of today, your and the Azonia students' debts have been erased."

"Why?"

"Because this kind-hearted young lady here decided to clear them all."

Kirin placed both hands on Chen Xia's shoulders, smiling.

Aru's eyes lit up. "Oh! Thanks!"

She stepped forward and eagerly shook Chen Xia's hands. "I'll pay you back for this someday."

"There's no need," Chen Xia replied in her usual gentle voice.

"Make sure the others know their debts are cleared too," Kirin added.

Aru nodded, then turned to Leo. "What about Black Rabbit?"

"I have some things to discuss with the student council president," Kirin said.

Understanding, Aru gave a small nod before leaving the room.

Now that only the three of them remained, Chen Xia spoke. "You seem quite close with Azonia's representative."

"We are close," Leo replied simply.

"Hmm." Chen Xia pursed her lips slightly. "You sure dote on her."

"She's cute. So are you."

"...What?"

Chen Xia blinked, momentarily flustered. Her face reddened before she huffed. "Sir Leo, you keep teasing me, but I *am* older than you."

"Yeah, yeah," Leo said dismissively.

Chen Xia pouted but soon let out a quiet sigh. She then stepped behind Leo and spoke in a cold, detached voice.

"Kirin Naylah."

"Yes, Princess," Kirin responded.

Chen Xia's expression had gone blank. She had shed her usual warmth, revealing the emotionless mask of a Shadow.

"Why did you insult Sir Leo?" she asked flatly.

Kirin bowed respectfully.

The Shadow Lords, the leaders of the elves, beastmen, and dwarves' Shadows were independent from the nation of Xian. However, that didn't mean they were entirely separate.

The first Shadow was Kyle.

Bihar, who inherited Kyle's will, became the ancestor of Xian.

In a way, all Shadows originated from Xian.

So while the Shadow Lords were technically independent of the Xian Empire, they were not *completely* autonomous.

Even the title of Shadow Lord was granted by the Emperor of Xian.

Because of this, Shadow Lords always respected the Master of Xian.

If it had been Chen Xia alone, she would have been granted an audience with Kirin the moment she arrived at the Casino of Shadows.

She was, after all, the next ruler of Xian.

But Leo had not been afforded the same treatment.

Kirin had *tested* him.

And that fact angered Chen Xia.

The Shadows had been *saved* by Leo.

Because of Leo, the Book of Shadows had been born, proving they had not been forsaken by the gods.

For Kirin to dare test *him*—Chen Xia found it unforgivable.

Glaring at Kirin, she radiated quiet fury.

Kirin, however, remained calm. "Please, set aside your anger and be generous with your understanding," she said smoothly. "Princess, I am a Shadow Lord."

Her gaze shifted to Leo. "The lives of thousands of Shadows depend on my judgment. I had to make sure. I needed to see for myself whether Sir Leo was truly a man capable of leading the Shadows."

Leo rested his chin on his hand. "And?"

Kirin smiled. "I could not deny it. You are more suited to be the God of Shadows than anyone else."
