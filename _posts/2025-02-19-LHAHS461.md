Emio Luce was known as one of the top five strongest students in the second-year Magic Department. That was why it was so shocking when he received an expulsion notice at the end of the first semester.

Even students who hadn't gotten along with Emio were stunned.

There was a known risk in the mentor system. If a mentee was expelled, then their mentor would be expelled as well. 

However, Emio's mentee, Lement, had survived the losers' revival match and barely avoided expulsion, which meang that Emio's expulsion was due entirely to his own failures.

Yet, on the surface, he was still considered one of the top five students in the Magic Department. That was why Emio felt his expulsion was completely unjust.

"Expelled?" His eyes gleamed dangerously.

Carl flinched and took a step back. "You... if you try anything..."

"Shut up!" With a furious shout, Emio raised his staff and aimed it at Carl.

*Whoooosh!*

A powerful gust surged toward him.

*Kwa-ga-ga-ga-ga—!*

The sudden offensive magic left the surrounding second-years stunned.

"What the hell?!"

"Isn't that Emio Luce?"

"Hey! Are you crazy?! You can't just use offensive magic here!"

"Are you throwing a tantrum because you got expelled? Have some shame!"

Before their protests could even finish, Emio's magic shot toward them. The second-years recoiled in shock.

Emio glared at them and roared, "Does this make any damn sense?! That talentless trash got to stay because of connections while I got expelled?! How the hell does that make sense?! The same goes for all of you! I'll wipe out every single incompetent insect and prove my worth to Lumene!"

From his bloodshot eyes and the bulging veins on his face, Emio was not in his right mind.

The second-years, initially stunned, were now glaring at Emio with killing intent. Even if he was one of the top mages, if he made an enemy of everyone here, he would be crushed instantly.

But having lost all reason, Emio didn't care.

At that moment, Leo appeared, pushing through the crowd. "I get how you feel, but don't you think you should stop?"

"Hah?! So the great hero finally graces us with his presence?" Emio's lips curled into a sneer. "If people found out that the great hero was playing favorites and protecting garbage, how do you think they'd react? Does it feel good? Expelling a student who deserved to stay?"

"The student council president has no authority to expel anyone. Also, I've never helped Carl once. He stayed at Lumene by his own ability."

"Where the hell are you getting that bullshit—?!"

"Just look." Leo gestured toward the magic Emio had just cast. "He's perfectly fine, isn't he?"

"Whoa! That was close!"

At those words, the windstorm dissipated, revealing Carl standing completely unharmed.

Emio's eyes widened in disbelief. "H-How?!"

Carl flashed a thumbs-up and shamelessly advertised his product, "Students! In times of danger, a Carl Thomas-brand Shield Bracelet is your best friend! Designed with both protection and style in mind, it ensures your safety while keeping you fashionable! A one-time use, but your life is priceless!"

Laughter erupted from the students around them.

"You son of a—!" Emio's face twisted in rage as he raised his staff at Carl once more.

"Emio Luce."

"...?!"

Leo's icy voice sent a shiver down Emio's spine. Even the other students flinched and instinctively took a step back.

"Here's a warning. Stop this useless nonsense." Leo stepped toward him. "Because I really don't feel like beating the crap out of a child."

"Don't give me that shit!" With a furious scream, Emio swung his staff violently.

*Ziiiing—!*

A massive surge of mana erupted.

*Kwa-ga-ga-ga-gang—!*

The mana exploded, swallowing Leo in a violent storm and blasting apart part of the dock.

"What the hell am I missing?! Weaker guys got to stay, but I got expelled?! Why?!" Emio screamed in rage.

The second-years narrowed their eyes and entered battle stances.

At that moment, a brilliant flash cut through the air, and a sharp blade slashed toward Emio.

*Swish—! Kwa-gagak—!*

"Ugh?!"

Though Emio had cast a full-body magic armor, the sword strike pierced through his defenses and cut him down.

*Tap—! Bwoong! Bwoong!*

Leaping lightly onto a floating piece of debris, Eliana grinned. "The Beautiful Swordswoman, Eliana Raden, has arrived!"

"You seriously say shit like that in a time like this?!"

"She actually called herself a 'beautiful swordswoman'... does she have no shame?"

"Ugh, unbelievable."

Despite the overwhelming ridicule, Eliana remained completely unfazed.

"I don't give a damn about you, so why don't you piss off, Eliana Raden? Unless you want to die," Emio growled menacingly.

"As a Lumene student, I simply cannot tolerate an outsider attacking my fellow classmates!" Eliana deliberately emphasized the fact that Emio was no longer a student.

Emio's face twisted with hatred. 

The playful smile vanished from Eliana's face. Gone was her usual easygoing demeanor—her gaze sharpened as she raised her sword. "Besides... I've been itching to beat your ass for a while now. You piss me off."

"You're just a half-baked mess of magic and swordplay!" Emio shouted, whipping his staff through the air.

*Fwoosh—!*

A towering pillar of fire erupted into the sky, instantly merging with a violent windstorm.

"Flame Tornado!"

*Kwooooosh—!*

Blades of wind, sharp enough to shred through steel, combined with searing flames. The firestorm surged toward Eliana.

*Kwakakakakak—!*

Explosions rippled through the air as the inferno blazed higher.

Emio grinned viciously.

*Flash—!*

At that moment, a pure white light split through the storm, and Eliana emerged.

Her uniform was scorched and torn in several places. Cuts littered her body, and blood seeped from her wounds.

Emio's magic had been powerful enough that Eliana hadn't been able to completely block it, but none of her injuries were fatal.

"H-How?!"

"Meh, it was nothing special. I just cut through it." Eliana grinned as she landed on the lake's surface.

*Splaash—!*

Water splattered everywhere, but Eliana stood atop the surface effortlessly with her Aura Step.

*Fwoosh—!*

Then, gripping her sword tightly, Eliana charged at Emio.

"A frontal assault?! How arrogant!" Emio gritted his teeth and fired off a barrage of spells.

True to his military lineage, his magic was both efficient and powerful.

Seeing the attack, Eliana extended her free hand forward.

*Flash—!*

A pure white, transparent barrier, like a shield made of glass, materialized. Using it, she deflected every incoming spell as she closed the distance.

"No way!" Emio's eyes widened in shock. Despite the high firepower of his magic, Eliana blocked it all.

*This makes no sense! We were supposed to be on equal footing!*

While Emio reeled in disbelief, Eliana, now right in front of him, smirked coldly. "You're ready for this, right?"

"Urgh—!"

*Bash! Thwack—!*

"Urk?!"

Eliana swung her sword with both hands, covering it in aura. Rather than cutting, she manifested her aura like a blunt weapon and struck him directly. The sheer impact sent Emio flying, his consciousness wavering.

*Kwagagagagang—!*

Like a skipping stone, he bounced across the water's surface several times before finally splashing into the lake.

"Hmph." Eliana casually brushed her hair back.

Seeing that, the students stared in shock.

"When did Eliana get this strong?"

"That was completely one-sided!"

As her classmates marveled, Eliana grinned and flashed a V-sign with her fingers.

*Kwagang—!*

Water surged upward, and Emio emerged.

"This damn woman...!"

His body trembling with rage, he glared at Eliana with wild eyes. Just a few months ago, at the beginning of second-year first semester, he and Eliana had been evenly matched.

"Don't make me laugh! If I had participated in the training camp... if I had been properly evaluated... I wouldn't have suffered this humiliation...!"

"You had already fallen behind Eliana months ago."

"Eek?!"

Eliana jumped in fright as Leo silently appeared behind her.

"President! You scared me!" she protested.

Leo patted her on the head and walked toward Emio. "Want me to tell you why you were expelled?"

"What?"

"It's true that you were one of the top second-year magic students. The problem is, you barely grew at all compared to the beginning of the semester."

"Don't talk nonsense!" Emio's face twisted in denial.

"Didn't you barely manage to keep up in theory classes?"

In terms of practical skills, Emio was still among the strongest in the Magic Department. But in written and theoretical subjects, his performance had plummeted compared to his first year.

Unlike other students at his level, who integrated new knowledge into their skills, Emio failed to adapt to the new curriculum. The only reason he hadn't completely failed was his previously accumulated scores.

Magic was a field that constantly required learning and adaptation, but Emio never did that.

Even in practical combat, students who had been weaker than him had made huge improvements, while he had stagnated.

"Most importantly, Emio, you freeze up whenever you meet someone stronger than you."

A hero was someone who challenged the impossible and overcame hardships. That was why heroes were always ready to fight someone stronger than themselves, but Emio was the opposite.

"It's true that you were one of the strongest second-years," Leo said, his expression unreadable. "But that also means you're just a second-year. And since you've already hit your limit, the professors determined you wouldn't survive at Lumene."

"Don't make me laugh."

"Starting in the second semester, students will have to put their lives on the line. At this rate, you'd die."

At those words, Emio's fists clenched tightly.

"The professors probably felt bad about it."

"Shut up! I deserve to be at Lumene!"

Eliana pouted as she watched Emio scream in blind rage. "See? Talking to him is pointless."

"Yeah. Then let me just be blunt." Leo cut straight to the point. "No matter how much trouble you cause, it won't change the fact that you were expelled. So just shut up and accept the fact that you're dropping out."

"Graaaaaaaaah! Leo Plov!"

With crazed eyes, Emio's mana surged... but then, Leo's red eyes flashed coldly.

*Crack—!*

The magic formation surrounding Emio shattered instantly, and the backlash staggered him.

"For any a proper graduate of Lumene's Magic Department, breaking these spell formations is effortless." Leo stepped closer. "This ends here. If you cause any more trouble, you won't get off easy."

"Graaaaaaaah!" With wild eyes, Emio lunged at Leo.

Leo sighed and snapped his fingers.

*Fwoooosh! Kwoooom—!*

Flames erupted, engulfing Emio before detonating.

Blasted high into the air, he crashed down.

*Sploosh—!*

Knocked unconscious, Emio floated in the water, eyes rolled back.

Looking down at him, Leo turned to his classmates. "Take him in and hand him over to the professors."

"Got it!"

"On it!"

The second-years restrained Emio with binding magic.

"Causing a mess on the first day of school, huh?" Leo let out a small sigh and shook his head.

*Step— Step—*

At the center of a vast plain stood a massive tomb.

In the distant past, this place had been a major battlefield against Tartaros. A land once filled with despair and death.

It was only saved by the sacrifice of a hero.

This grave belonged to the hero who had saved this place.

A hooded man stood before the gravestone and reached out a ghastly skeletal hand.

*Clench—!*

Grasping the gravestone, the figure murmured.

*Crack—! Creak—!*

Moments later, the earth split apart, and a skeletal corpse rose from the grave.

The skeleton, now standing, twisted its bizarrely bent neck to stare at the man. [You... the Archduke of Mourning...!]

The figure's eyes gleamed as the Archduke of Mourning, Artkan, smirked. "Are you not interested in a second life? A hero wrongfully sacrificed."

The skeletal figure, filled with hatred, reached out its hand... but then, it froze mid-motion.

[A... second... life...?]
