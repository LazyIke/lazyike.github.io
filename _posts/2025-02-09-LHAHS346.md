The exam period was only a week away, and tension ran high among Seiren's first-year students. 

"This is my seat." 

"It was empty. Why would it be yours?" 

"I just stepped away for a moment. My books were here." 

"I didn't see any books." 

"What? Did you move them on purpose?" 

Inside the first-year library—a place meant for quiet study—sharp voices clashed. 

"Both of you, shut up. Can't you see people are trying to study?" 

A voice, thick with irritation, cut through the argument. 

The two students, who had been glaring daggers at each other, flinched. 

A female student scoffed, looking down on them. 

"Hah. Typical intermediate-class nobodies, causing trouble for others." 

"What? What did you just say?" 

"You're barely in Advanced Class 3 yourself!" 

"Oh? Are you really comparing the advanced class to the intermediate class, you bottom-feeders?" 

"You little—!" 

Voices rose again. 

Eclair, who had been studying, finally stood up. 

As the exam period approached, the atmosphere among the first-years had grown razor-sharp. 

Conflicts had become common, especially between students of Intermediate Class 1, who were eager to climb up, and those in Advanced Class 3, who were constantly at risk of falling down. 

*This isn't right.* 

Eclair murmured to herself. 

She was in Advanced Class 1. More than that, she was the first-year representative. 

But lately, she felt completely out of place in the school. 

She understood that, as a school, competition was inevitable. She also knew many sought to take her spot as class representative. 

However, the hostility had become blatant. 

Except for Lea and Elric, whose grades were higher than hers, the rest of Advanced Class 1 focused entirely on keeping Eclair in check. 

Many refused to even speak to her. Those who did talked behind her back. 

And it wasn't just her. 

The entire class was filled with students constantly trying to outdo one another. 

*Mr. Jeras, the new homeroom teacher, only seems to encourage this cutthroat atmosphere...* 

The only exception was Lea. 

She was overwhelmingly the top-ranked student and a direct descendant of the Tingel family. 

Everyone wanted to get close to her. 

Some even deliberately tried to drive a wedge between her and Eclair. 

The noble students, who saw Eclair's Welrune family as insignificant, were especially blatant about it. 

Of course, Lea completely ignored them. 

*But...having only two people I can really talk to? I never imagined school life would be like this.* 

Eclair drooped her ears and started searching for a quieter place to study. 

As the third-ranked student, she had to give it her best effort. 

Eventually, she arrived at a secluded part of the first-year building—the outer edges of the Castle of Beginnings. 

The old classrooms here were barely used. It was an isolated place where few ever came. 

*This should be quiet enough to study...* 

"Hahaha!" 

A burst of laughter rang out from somewhere ahead. 

Eclair's ears perked up. 

The laughter sounded...genuinely happy. 

Hugging her textbook to her chest, she cautiously followed the sound. 

When she arrived at an old hallway, her eyes widened. 

*Lower class?* 

Before she even realized it, she had wandered into the lower-class area. 

As she blinked in confusion, the sound of voices reached her ears. 

"Correct! The Emmetra mana formula!" 

"Wrong!" 

"Argh!" 

"You idiot! How could you get it wrong?! That means a penalty!" 

"Penalty! Penalty!" 

Laughter and jeering filled the air, but it was all in good fun. 

Eclair swallowed hard, then carefully opened the back door of the classroom and peeked inside. 

The lower-class students were split into teams, competing in a quiz match. 

The questions all seemed to be from the upcoming midterm's written exam. 

For penalties, they had to eat incredibly sour and spicy fruits. 

Watching their lively energy, Eclair stood frozen. 

*Creak—!* 

"Huh?!" 

The door suddenly swung open. 

*Thud—!* 

"Ugh?!" 

Having leaned against the door while watching, Eclair tumbled forward and crashed onto the floor. 

For a brief moment, a hundred pairs of eyes from the lower-class students locked onto her.

"Eclair Welrune?"

"You're the class representative, aren't you?" 

"What's a class rep doing in the lower-class section?" 

The lower-class students eyed Eclair warily. 

"A-Ah, sorry! I was just looking for a place to study and ended up here by accident!" 

As she hurriedly got to her feet, their suspicion didn't wane. 

"Wait a minute. Are you spying on us?" 

"Yeah! Maybe you're here to snitch to the advanced-class teachers." 

It wasn't uncommon for advanced and intermediate students to find excuses to report the lower class, falsely accusing them of violating school regulations just to elevate themselves. 

And with the lower-class students secretly studying *Introduction to Stellar Magic*, they couldn't afford to take any chances. Their wariness only grew stronger. 

Facing blatant distrust and hostility, Eclair waved her hands frantically. 

"N-No! I swear, I really just came here to study for the exams! That's all!" 

Tears welled up in her eyes as she spoke. 

"Guys, that's enough. She said she's just here to study." 

Angel stepped in, calming her classmates. 

"And besides, Eclair Welrune isn't like the other advanced-class students. She's nice." 

"If Angel says so..." 

"But still, isn't she the class rep? Shouldn't she have the best study spots in the library?" 

"Yeah, why'd she come all the way to the lower-class section?" 

The students exchanged puzzled looks. 

"Advanced class has its own struggles too." 

At Leo's remark, Eclair's ears drooped. 

Angel scratched her cheek awkwardly before offering, "If you ever need a place to study during self-study periods, why don't you join us?" 

"R-Really? Is that okay?" 

Eclair's face lit up. 

Angel nodded. 

"Of course. Everyone's fine with it, right?" 

"Yeah, we don't mind." 

Since Angel was essentially the class leader, most followed her decision. 

Watching the scene, Leo smirked. 

*The atmosphere here is nice.* 

The next day, as soon as classes ended, Eclair walked off with clear purpose. 

Her movements didn't go unnoticed. 

"Did you hear? Eclair was hanging out with the lower-class students yesterday." 

"What a disgrace to the advanced class." 

Sneering whispers filled the room. 

Lea, putting away her books, shot a glare at the gossiping students before glancing toward the door Eclair had left through. 

*I'm so jealous, Eclair!* 

The lower class had Leo—someone Lea deeply respected. 

And now, Eclair was off to study with him. 

*By now, the lower-class students must be receiving Senior Plov's guidance. I want to study with them too...* 

But she couldn't. 

Leo had told her seniors, Lunia and Eiran, something she couldn't forget. 

*"The lower-class students need to improve on their own for it to be meaningful."* 

If she went to study with them, people would talk. 

*Of course, Eclair is the class rep too, so there will still be rumors...* 

But Lea couldn't bring herself to stop her. 

She knew how hard Eclair was struggling with school life. 

*Eclair just wants to make more friends.* 

Right now, the atmosphere in both the advanced and intermediate classes made that impossible. 

As Lea let out a small sigh, a voice called to her. 

"Lea." 

"Hmm? Oh, Elric." 

"Shouldn't we stop Eclair?" 

Elric's tone was laced with concern. 

Lea simply slung her bag over her shoulder. 

"She'll be fine. Don't worry too much." 

"Still..." 

"If anything, *you* should be worried." 

"What?" 

"You might lose your second-place spot to her." 

Lea grinned playfully and walked out of the classroom. 

*This school needs to change.* 

Lea sighed as she walked, feeling the weight of the gazes around her. 

Ever since hearing Leo's perspective, the things she had once accepted as normal now looked different. 

She saw clearly how the lower-class students were being blatantly discriminated against. 

*If things don't change, then no matter what my father says, I'll transfer to Lumene.* 

She clasped her hands together, lost in thought. 

*Then I could train under Senior Plov and enjoy a happy school life!* 

As Lea left, the classroom fell silent. 

Mr. Jeras narrowed his eyes. 

*Eclair Welrune...associating with the lower class? As expected, a low-born family's child will always act beneath their station.* 

Annoyance flickered across his face before his lips curled into a smirk. 

A sheet of paper lay in his hand—the official team assignments for the upcoming practical exam. 

As the homeroom teacher of Advanced Class 1, his authority was absolute. 

He controlled how all the first-year students would be grouped. 

*Let's see if she still thinks it's a good idea to mix with them after experiencing firsthand what it means to be among the lower class.*

After school, while the lower-class students gathered in their classroom for self-study in preparation for the exams, Laura called Leo aside. 

"Leo, the practical exam team assignments just arrived." 

Her voice carried a hint of reluctance. 

"You're not on the list, of course." 

"Naturally." 

Leo wasn't officially a Seiren student. If his name had appeared on the list, that would have been a serious issue. Even if he had been included, it would have completely disrupted the balance. 

No matter how talented Seiren's first-years were, none of them were remotely capable of competing with Leo yet. 

"Yes, but there's something strange about it." 

"Strange?" 

"Yes. The class representative, Eclair, has been assigned to the same group as our lower-class students." 

Leo raised an eyebrow. 

"Eclair? With the lower-class students?" 

"Yes. I think it's because she's been spending time with them. She must have caught Jeras' attention." 

Laura let out a tired sigh. 

Leo's expression turned flat. 

"Aren't the advanced-class teachers the ones who look down on the lower class?" 

"...That's right." 

"And yet, they put her in a group with them?" 

"Yes." 

Leo glanced toward the lower-class students, where Eclair was chatting and laughing among them, completely unaware of the situation. 

*That group is guaranteed to place in the top five at the very least. What is that advanced-class professor thinking?*

The day of Seiren's first-year midterm practical exam had arrived. 

All first-year students gathered at the outskirts of the Starting Hall, where the exam would take place. 

Since the task was monster subjugation, tension filled the air. Some students, however, brimmed with excitement at the opportunity to showcase their abilities in front of their seniors. 

For the first-years, this was their first official chance to demonstrate their skills before their upperclassmen. Many of them hoped to leave an impression on well-known seniors. 

"Wait, aren't those the second-year Trina siblings?" 

"It is!" 

"Should we try talking to them?" 

The first-years buzzed with excitement at the sight of Alice and Garin Trina, the fourth and fifth-ranked students of the second year. 

Even the lower-class students took notice. 

"Whoa! It's Alice and Garin!" 

"I really admire them." 

The Trina siblings had started out in the lower class when they first entered Seiren. But after a grueling first semester of relentless effort, they had clawed their way up to Advanced Class 1. 

Eiran, the second-ranked student of the second year, had also begun in the intermediate class before skyrocketing to second place. But for the lower-class students, it was the Trina siblings—who had started at the very bottom—that were the most inspiring. 

Leo glanced over at the lower-class students. 

Despite all their studying and preparation, they were visibly nervous now that the exam was about to begin. 

His gaze shifted to the Trina siblings. 

"Let's see if any promising underclassmen stand out." 

Alice, the younger of the two, scanned the crowd with a meaningful smile. 

Garin puffed out his chest. 

"I can already feel the admiration from our juniors." 

"They're not looking at you. They're looking at me." Alice smirked.

Garin scowled. "What? No, they're definitely looking at *me*." 

"There are three reasons why they'd be looking at me instead. Want to hear them?" 

"Try me." 

"First, I get better grades than you. Second, I was a class representative. Third, *you* have never been a class representative. Makes sense, right?" 

"As if your grades are *that* much better than mine! And you barely lasted a week as class rep! Also, did you seriously just call your Oppa 'you' informally?!" 

"If you don't like it, get higher grades than me! And I don't care if you were born thirty seconds earlier—only studious older siblings are supposed to be called 'Oppa!' So that makes me the Noona here!" 

"That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard!" 

Just as the twins were about to start another full-blown argument, someone approached them. 

The surrounding first-years hesitated, unsure if they should interfere in a senior's quarrel, but muffled chuckles soon spread. 

"Wait, isn't that a lower-class student?" 

"A lower-class kid talking to an advanced-class senior?" 

"Seriously? They don't know their place." 

Ignoring the sneers, Leo walked up to the Trina siblings. 

"Excuse me, seniors. The students in my class really look up to you. Would you mind saying a few words of encouragement?" 

The twins, who had been seconds away from grabbing each other by the collar, froze. 

Clearing their throats, they turned to see who had spoken to them. 

"Yeah, sure, what class are you fr—cough!" 

"Brother, why are you—oh...?" 

Their faces paled the moment they recognized Leo. 

"Y-Y-You! Why are *you* here?!" 

"And why are you wearing our school uniform?!" 

"Shh." 

Leo pressed a finger to his lips, smirking. 

Garin and Alice immediately clamped their mouths shut. 

"Could you cheer for my class? They're lower-class students, after all." 

Leo gestured toward the group, where several students stood frozen, mouths agape. 

Garin and Alice exchanged glances before approaching the lower-class students. 

Everyone's eyes widened. 

Then Garin spoke. 

"Don't let being in the lower class get to you!" 

"Yeah! If you work hard, you can make it too! Even this idiot managed to get into the advanced class!" 

"*Idiot*?! Did you just call me an idiot?!" 

"If you don't like it, get better grades than me!" 

"I'm telling Mom!" 

"Ack! If you do, I'll tell Dad you pulled my hair!" 

Just like that, their encouragement devolved into another bickering match. 

The lower-class students burst into laughter. 

Leo chuckled along before turning to his classmates. 

"Relax. Just do what we practiced, and I promise you..." 

He shifted his gaze toward the intermediate and advanced-class students, his voice filled with quiet confidence. 

"By the time this exam is over, the rankings will have changed."
