*Boom—!*

Erebos stepped forward.

*Kraaaash—!*

With just a single step, the ground trembled violently.

*Fwoosh—!*

Black flames surged fiercely around Erebos. Even from a great distance, an unbearable heat radiated outward.

Torua wiped the cold sweat from her forehead and muttered, "Just its mere existence is this overwhelming."

Erebos hadn't used any special power. It had simply taken a step. And yet, it was as if a massive calamity had struck. The sky darkened, glowing an even more ominous crimson.

Ulta, carrying Raynia in front of him, murmured, "I see now. This is why Aaron didn't bring any other vanguard."

Aside from Aaron, most of the party members specialized in long-range attacks.

Lunia, Eiran, and Eliza formed a single unit. Lunia focused solely on attacking with the Phoenix King's white flames. Eiran, using her family's unique magic—Animus's Sword and Armor—became Lunia's shield. Meanwhile, Eliza carried Lunia, ensuring they could evade Erebos's attacks.

The formation was designed so that the still-inexperienced Lunia could concentrate entirely on offense.

"At first, I thought Aaron handling the vanguard alone was just because he was the Brave Hero... but that wasn't it," Raynia said, wiping her forehead. "If another knight-class had taken the frontlines, they'd have been reduced to ashes in an instant."

The reason Aaron hadn't brought warriors like Rhys, Jamua, or Vanir was simple. They weren't qualified to stand here yet. And truthfully, neither were they. All they could do was support Aaron from outside the battlefield.

*Well, except for the one student who's already on that stage.*

Raynia looked up at the sky. There, overlooking Erebos, stood Leo.

Taking a deep breath, Raynia raised her bow. "I'm counting on you, Ulta."

"Leave it to me."

Among the hero candidates present, Raynia had the strongest firepower. A former Seiren student council president. A magic-using archer who wielded both mana and aura.

Back in her time, simply being strong wasn't enough to become Seiren's student council president.

*That has changed now, though.*

Until last year, only the strongest Stellar Magic user could hold that position.

Torua then launched Lunia toward Eliza. "I'm counting on you, my ill-tempered summoning department junior."

"You sure sound relaxed for this situation."

"Of course. Our job is only to support Aaron from outside the battlefield. Besides..."

Torua looked at Aaron's back as he stood before the massive, black calamity.

"We have the Brave Hero with us."

[Are you prepared... to watch the world burn once again?]

Aaron narrowed his eyes.

Seeing this, Erebos's gaze twitched. Aaron's eyes held no fear.

[Oh?] Erebos's expression shifted with interest. [Even at the moment you faced death, you were never ready to accept it. And yet now, you do not fear it at all.]

Aaron pointed his sword at Erebos, his face unreadable.

[Did experiencing death rid you of ignorance-born fear? Or...]

*Swish—!*

Erebos raised its massive black arm.

[Is it because you are nothing more than a lingering remnant of the past, indifferent to life and death?!]

*Kraaaaaash—!*

Erebos swung its arm with full force, sending a column of black fire surging into the sky. The flames engulfed Aaron completely.

"Aaron!" Melina shouted urgently.

Leo responded calmly, "He's fine."

"What?"

"That's not nearly enough to take him down."

As soon as he spoke, golden light burst through the black flames.

Aaron gripped his sword with both hands.

*Vwooom—!*

"Hoo..." He took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and focused.

Hyper Perception activated.

When he opened his eyes, he could see the flames writhing around Erebos. He saw the monstrous sneer twisting Erebos's face. A clear mockery directed at him.

But Aaron didn't care.

*I am calm.*

Aaron had lost. No one knew that truth better than him. The moment his Hyper Perception revealed Kyle and Luna's deaths, Aaron had been consumed by terror. And in their place, he had chosen to die. Because he had feared seeing his friends die.

*But when Kyle came to save me, I gave up.*

In his final moments, Aaron had doubted that the world could be saved. He had despaired.

*Dweno would never have given up.*

He thought of his friend, who had a will as unyielding as steel.

*Luna would have believed in her own potential until the very end.*

A friend who had absolute faith in herself.

*Lysinas would never have let go of hope.*

A friend who had carried the greatest hope of all.

*Because she believed that Kyle would never give up. Unlike me.*

Aaron raised his sword upright. His expressionless face was reflected in the blade. A coward who had been terrified countless times. A man who had finally broken.

*But thanks to my friends, I was able to see the world they saved. I have no more regrets. So...*

"I'll make sure you are completely annihilated!"

*Flash!*

With Aaron's declaration, a golden sword aura slashed toward Erebos's neck.

But it didn't cut through.

*Kraaaaaash!*

Erebos's massive body crashed to the ground.

"Remnants of the past... will be dealt with by a ghost of the past!"

Aaron pointed his sword toward the sky.

*Swish—!*

Brilliant golden light soared upward. A small golden sphere exploded in the sky like a miniature sun.

*Flash—! Kraaaaaaash—!*

A downpour of golden sword energy rained from the heavens, striking Erebos.

"My god."

"That... is a Great Hero in battle...!"

The hero candidates standing atop the fortress walls gaped in awe.

The sight of a Great Hero in battle was truly beyond comprehension. Even for those who had spent their entire lives hearing tales of the Great Heroes, admiring and idolizing them, and praising their strength and achievements, the sight was utterly shocking.

"So that's why they were able to save the world," Duran muttered, his face filled with reverence.

"Wow... I thought the battle at Godthrone was incredible, but this is on an entirely different level."

Beside him, Carl clicked his tongue in amazement. Even Carl, who had previously witnessed Aaron's power firsthand, was taken aback.

"So this is Aaron from the Final Chapter?"

It was exactly as described in the records. He was, quite literally, the God of War incarnate.

"Leo... is standing on the very frontlines of a battle like that?" Abad murmured quietly.

With Aaron's assault as the signal, Torua, Ulta, and Raynia launched their attacks. Torua's magic pierced through the flames emanating from Erebos and struck its body directly. Ulta, riding atop a Pegasus, soared at incredible speeds, blocking Erebos's flames.

*Fwoooosh—!*

At that moment, an enormous blaze of pure white flames erupted high into the sky.

Seeing it, Drianna murmured, "Lunia."

The moment she spoke...

*Whoooosh—!*

Flame Emperor engulfed Erebos.

A chorus of cheers erupted from the Seiren students.

"As expected of Senior Lunia!"

"The next student council president of Seiren!"

"According to the records, the Phoenix King's flames are said to be an unquenchable fire, right?"

The Seiren first-years' eyes sparkled.

*Kraaaash!*

However, the moment Erebos emerged from the white flames, they flinched. Even after taking a direct hit from Torua and Lunia's magic, Erebos showed no signs of faltering.

"Even after taking a hit like that, it doesn't even flinch...?"

"Would it even be possible to participate in a battle like this...?"

Fearful murmurs spread not only among the first-years but also the second-years.

Celia furrowed her brow at the sight. It was natural for people to feel fear when confronted with something beyond imagination.

*I was the same way.*

During the first semester's midterms, Leo's presence had been nothing short of terrifying. She had been overwhelmed by him, overcome with despair. She had thought she could never catch up to him.

*But I couldn't just bow my head forever.*

Leo's back as he moved forward... It was as if he was telling them to follow. As if he was saying he would be waiting for the day they could stand on the same battlefield.

*If only the others could realize that, too.*

As Celia pondered how to encourage her peers and juniors...

*Thud—Thud—Thud—!*

Aru stomped her foot in frustration.

"What's wrong?" Carl asked.

"I'm frustrated!" Aru shouted.

"What?"

"Black Rabbit, that ill-tempered elf, and Eiran... they're all up there on that stage!"

"Well, Leo is exceptional, and Lunia and Eiran have unique abilities, so of course they're there. It's not like you're lacking..."

"That's why it's frustrating!"

Aru's body began to change. Her feline traits became more pronounced. She had transformed.

Like a hissing cat, her fur and hair stood on end as she spoke. "I still don't have the right to stand on that battlefield! The great Brave Hero is here, and I can't even share the honor of standing beside him!"

All eyes turned to Aru.

"I'm furious! I need to take this anger out on those ugly monsters! Nyaaaah!"

With a sharp cry, Aru dashed toward the fortress walls.

Watching her retreating figure, the students who had been paralyzed by fear clenched their teeth, their faces filled with shame.

While they had been cowering, someone else had been frustrated that they couldn't join the fight. The stark contrast made them feel humiliated.

"Damn it!"

"Am I really this weak? No, I'm not!"

They screamed to shake off their fear.

Seeing them, Celia murmured, "Was that intentional?"

"That idiot? No way," Carl let out a dry laugh.

Beside him, Drianna nodded. "It definitely wasn't intentional. But I think that's Aru's power."

"Aru's power?" Celia tilted her head.

"The Brave Hero personally chose her as his successor. It's not strange that her actions would inspire courage in others."

Drianna chuckled and pulled a massive battle axe from her subspace storage. 

Watching her, Celia clenched and unclenched her fists. "Yeah, I can't just sit back and do nothing."

The battlefield wasn't just over there.

*Kuwaaaaaah—!*

Demonic beasts, created by Erebos's power, swarmed the fortress walls.

"Leo, your orders," Melina said.

Leo replied, "Melina, you're Lysinas's successor, aren't you?"

"Huh? Ah, yes. I am unworthy, but I did conquer Lysinas's World..."

"Then you take command."

"What?" Melina was taken aback. "B-But how could I possibly lead when Leo is here..."

"Leadership was always Lysinas's role."

"...!"

"How long do you plan on staying silent?"

At Leo's cold words, Melina gritted her teeth and lowered her head.

Back when they challenged Dawn's World, Melina had been the one in charge. And her party had been wiped out.

Since then, Melina had become the Silent Dragon.

Even now, despite having broken her silence, she hesitated to lead against Erebos.

Seeing her hesitate, Leo spoke. "Melina."

"...Yes."

"Look over there." Leo pointed toward Aaron, who was fighting against Erebos.

"Leo..."

"If you're afraid, then look at that back. We all drew courage from that sight. If you can't trust yourself, then trust me. I guarantee that you have the ability to lead this party and fight against Erebos."

At those words, Melina took a deep breath. "Yes!"

Leo grinned.

"What about you, Leo?"

"Me?"

Leo extended his hand. A staff materialized in a burst of radiant light.

"It might not suit me, but..." Leo twirled the end of the staff with his fingers. "I think I'll try imitating Luna for once."
