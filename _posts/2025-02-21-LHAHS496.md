Beneath the gray sky, the Great Heroes, having finished their battle against the legion commander, panted heavily.

"I-I really thought I was going to die this time," Aaron gasped, his face deathly pale.

Even the usually unshakable Dweno muttered grimly as he lowered his battle axe, "I agree. Who would have thought that one of the legion commanders had such an ability?" 

"Still, with this, we've taken down a second formidable foe after Jörmungandr. Well done, everyone," Lysinas said, taking a deep breath.

"Where are Kyle and Luna?" Dweno asked with a puzzled expression.

"Luna said she was taking Kyle to a library in this district."

"Tsk. The one who needs rest the most was taken away by the one who's in perfect condition."

At those words, Lysinas let out a bitter smile. This particular legion commander had been a natural enemy for Kyle. On the other hand, Luna had strong resistance to the commander's power.

*If it hadn't been for Luna, this battle would have been truly dangerous.*

Even Lysinas shuddered at the thought.

"But why does Luna always bring back a pile of grimoires from the libraries in liberated cities?" Aaron, the only one in the party who was completely ignorant of magic, asked with a puzzled look.

"To study magic."

"Luna is already the greatest mage in the world. Is there even anything left for her to learn?"

Even after Dweno explained, Aaron still looked unconvinced.

Seeing this, Lysinas said, "There's a saying among mages: Even the greatest mage has something to learn from a street fortune teller."

"Ohh. So Luna reads more grimoires to improve herself?"

"In simple terms, yes. But more than that, Luna has a dream."

"A dream? What is it?" Aaron tilted his head.

"Luna wants to know every magic that exists in this world."

"Isn't that way too ridiculous?"

Aaron's jaw dropped. Even someone like him, who didn't understand magic, knew that the world contained an immeasurable number of spells. Knowing them all was something close to impossible.

"It is ridiculous. Magic is a field that constantly explores the unknown," Lysinas smiled. "But for a mage like Luna, learning new magic must be a joy beyond comparison."

*Whooosh—!*

A dry wind blew past.

"For Luna, a world full of magic she doesn't yet know must be paradise."

Having arrived at the second-year magic department's library, Luna stared blankly at the countless grimoires before her and muttered, "...Is this paradise?"

With trembling hands, she opened a basic magic textbook used by modern mages. Then, pressing the back of her hand to her eyes, she groaned and staggered.

"Ahhh—! This is so amazing, I might just die. No, I'd be fine with dying."

"You're already dead," Leo remarked sarcastically.

Luna ignored him, fully absorbed in reading the grimoire.

*If it's a spell in an introductory textbook, it must be mostly activation formulas.*

Leo had only been exposed to modern magic after enrolling at Lumene. That was when he first encountered the concept of activation formulas. Despite being a powerful mage, his knowledge was based on magic from 5000 years ago. Back then, he hadn't even known what activation formulas were.

"Wow, in the future, you can just memorize a formula, and it activates on its own?"

On the other hand, Luna quickly grasped the structure of the activation formulas just by looking at them for a short while.

"I really want to try one."

"This is the magic department's library, so simple magic should be fine to use."

"Alright then. Hoi!"

Luna activated a simple spell using the activation formula.

"That's incredible."

It was a simple fire spell that ignited a flame, but she was amazed. Without hesitation, Luna modified the activation formula on the spot, transforming the fire spell into a fireball.

"You're still as amazing as ever."

"Hmph. Who do you think I am? I'm the great Lady Luna."

Luna grinned arrogantly, having mastered activation formulas just by glancing at them once.

After dispelling the magic, Luna suddenly gasped.

"Maybe the regret keeping me here is that I never got to see the full possibilities of magic?"

Leo stroked his chin. "That might actually be it."

"Hehe. Yeah. I always had a strong desire to explore magic."

"You used to stare greedily at new grimoires like they were treasures."

"You have a really weird way with words. Do you really think 'greedy' is the right word to describe someone as pure and elegant as me?"

"It suits you perfectly."

Luna punched Leo in the side, and Leo grimaced in pain, clutching his ribs.

"Anyway, you'll have plenty of time to read grimoires later, so let's stop here for now."

"But I want to keep reading." Luna hugged the grimoire tightly and pouted.

Leo clicked his tongue. "There's someone you need to meet."

"Someone I need to meet?"

Luna blinked a few times at Leo's words.

[Ah.]

The Fairy King, who had lived for 5000 years, trembled as he looked at his past oathbound companion before him.

[This... isn't a dream, is it?]

"You've grown so much, Sylord. Well, 5000 years have passed, after all."

[Luna!]

Sylord flew toward Luna, who was smiling with tears in her eyes. Hanging onto Luna's hair, his tiny shoulders quivered.

"Yeah. You've done well. You really have." Luna gently stroked Sylord's hair with the tip of her finger as she smiled.

Watching the scene, Leo let out a bitter chuckle.

*To think I'd see Luna and Sylord together again in this era.*

Luna had been there at the moment of Sylord's birth, and from that instant, they had formed an oath. Though they were bound by it, more than anything, they were like family.

*One of Luna's lingering regrets might have been breaking her promise to Sylord.*

Before setting off on their final journey, Luna had promised Sylord that she would definitely return. But in the end, she had broken that promise and closed her eyes for the last time.

If that regret had held her back, then this reunion would surely be a comfort to Luna.

At the Fairy King's dwelling, the three who had once fought to save the world during the Age of Calamity sat down and talked.

"So, who did Velkia end up marrying?"

"She married an ordinary elven youth. Surprising, right?"

"An ordinary elven youth?" Luna's eyes widened. 

Leo, too, was hearing this for the first time.

"That girl used to go around saying she'd never marry a man weaker than her."

"Yeah, she definitely did."

"He was ordinary but very sincere and kind. A man suited for the new era," Sylord recalled. "He had a calming presence. Maybe that's why Velkia chose Myde."

"She chose him?" Luna tilted her head.

"Velkia was really exhausted at the time." Sylord let out a small sigh. "Rebuilding the world wasn't easy. The shattered order had to be restored. After Lysinas disappeared, the order of Godthrone that she had established turned into chaos."

If the Great Heroes had still been alive after saving the world, perhaps things would have remained peaceful. But in the process of defeating Erebos, they had all vanished.

The Great Heroes had undoubtedly been the saviors of this world. But before that, they had also been its deterrent. 

After all, not everyone was righteous. Some people had kind hearts, but others harbored twisted desires. And in a world on the brink of destruction, twisted desires were a direct path to ruin.

Lysinas had never tolerated such people.

*I dealt with the ones lurking in the shadows myself.*

[Among the residents of Godthrone, many transformed into villains consumed by their desires.]

"I can't believe it. I thought everyone in Godthrone was good." Luna's expression darkened.

[Looking back now, I think they were all suppressing their true nature.]

The Great Heroes and countless heroes had set an example by sacrificing themselves for the world. In a way, the world on the verge of destruction had been an incredibly righteous and orderly place. Many had placed others before themselves.

"So, you're saying they hid their true nature because they were afraid of our power?"

At Leo's muttering, Luna pondered for a moment before speaking seriously.

"I don't think that's the whole story. Maybe they just wanted to live meaningful lives in a world that could end at any moment." Luna gave a bitter smile. "Every time a crisis hit Godthrone, people helped each other. What we saw back then—there was no falsehood in that."

Leo recalled the past. To him, who had reincarnated, it felt like a distant memory. But to Luna, it was as clear as if it had happened yesterday.

"It's ironic, isn't it? That people are at their kindest when the world is on the brink of destruction."

"That's probably why the world survived," Luna answered solemnly.

"So, she met a man during the process of rebuilding the world and fell in love?"

[Yes.]

"Was she happy?" Leo asked bluntly.

Sylord smiled. [She looked incredibly happy when she was with Myde. Just like when she was with you two.]

"That's a relief." Leo let out a small chuckle.

"What's this? After all that bickering with Velkia? Weren't you the one who said she needed to suffer a bit with a troublesome man to grow up?"

"What do you take me for?"

"A garbage human being," Luna answered without hesitation, flashing a bright smile.

Leo clicked his tongue at her. "I worry about those who were left behind too. Besides..."

"Besides?"

"That girl apparently thought of me like a father."

Luna's eyes widened at the unexpected words.

"She thought of you... as a father?"

"Yeah."

"How do you know that?"

"She said it herself. I heard it in Hero World."

At that, Luna stared at Leo, then suddenly burst into laughter.

"It actually kind of suits you."

*It really was like a strict father and his rebellious teenage daughter.*

Luna chuckled to herself, looking slightly excited.

"Then does that make me the mom?"

"Mom, my ass. You were just as immature as her. She probably thought of you as an older sister at best."

Luna kicked Leo's butt. Of course, Leo dodged.

As Luna fumed, Sylord laughed and said, "Velkia thought of both of you as her parents."

"See! I told you! I thought of Velkia like my own daughter!"

Luna folded her arms, looking smug.

"If you really thought of her as a daughter, you should have disciplined her more. You spoiled her so much she got more arrogant by the day." Leo grumbled.

Luna just plugged her ears and ignored him.

Clicking his tongue, Leo turned to Sylord. "Sylord, let's talk in private for a bit."

[Alright.]

"What are you two whispering about?"

"It's about Bihar."

Leo and Sylord moved to a corner of the Fairy King's dwelling.

Crossing his arms, Leo spoke "You said the world was chaotic after we died, right?"

[Yes.]

"I'll be direct. I already have an idea, but... what kind of life did Bihar live?"

[...]

Sylord closed his eyes at Leo's question. Then, he spoke heavily.

[She lived a life of hunting down those who brought harm to the world. As if she couldn't allow them to exist. Wherever she appeared, there was always a sea of blood. People feared Bihar more than they feared the demons.]

"So Velkia really thought of me and Leo as her parents, huh?"

That morning, as she prepared for the expedition, Luna recalled her disciple who had once come to see her.

*I'm glad... she lived a happy life.*

*I will never disgrace my masters' names. And if anyone ever does, I will never forgive them.*

*We will definitely return, Velkia.*

*Still! Even after you return, there will be people secretly slandering you! I will never, ever, ever forgive them!*

Velkia's words came to mind.

*It's a shame. I wish I had known sooner.*

Luna's eyes grew misty.

*I wish I could have seen Velkia happy.*

Even knowing she had lived happily didn't feel like enough. It was as if an even greater thirst was left unquenched—an even deeper regret remained.

Luna whispered to herself, "But really, this is wonderful."

The world they had saved was truly beautiful, and even magic had advanced. Even though she had only been here for a few days, it was a truly joyful world.

Luna looked at Leo.

*...This is bad. I think I might start having regrets.*
