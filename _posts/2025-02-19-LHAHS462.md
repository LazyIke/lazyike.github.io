The second semester's opening ceremony ended. As the students wrapped up their schedules, they made their way back to the dormitory buildings.

Eliana, the first to enter Glory Dormitory, dove onto the lounge sofa as if making a diving attack. "Home sweet home! I really missed this lounge sofa~" 

She rolled around as if it were her own bed.

The other students, long used to her antics, casually took their seats in the lounge.

"Hey, how was your training camp?"

"What was it like meeting the Brave Hero in person? Was he overwhelming?"

"I'm so jealous! I wish I had been there!"

Students flocked around those who had participated in the training camp. Since the opening ceremony had kept them busy, they hadn't had the chance to ask earlier. And, of course, what they were most curious about was Aaron.

Seeing her dorm mates gathering around, Eliana sat up, straightened her posture, and lifted her chin with an air of dignity.

"If you're curious, offer me cookies and tea."

The moment she said that, the students coldly turned away and instead surrounded Chen Xia and Chloe.

"Well, having some snacks while we talk wouldn't be a bad idea," Chloe said with a laugh.

"Ooooh!"

Students rushed off to the store in a frenzy.

Eliana gaped. "Why do they listen when Chloe says it?!"

"You told them to bring snacks just for yourself."

"Yeah, what are you, a pig?"

"How do I look like a pig?! And how could you say something so rude to a lady?!" Eliana grabbed a cushion and swung it at the male students mocking her.

"Things sure are lively," Leo remarked, entering the lounge with a smile.

"Leo, we're just about to talk about what happened during the training camp. Come join us," Chloe said, patting the seat next to her on the sofa.

The lively lounge suddenly fell silent.

Chloe and Eliana exchanged puzzled glances at the abrupt change.

"I'm going to head up and rest early today," Leo said.

"You're going to bed pretty early," Chen Xia commented.

"The opening ceremony was hectic, so I'm a little tired," Leo replied.

"Well, as the student council president, your schedule must have been exhausting. Would you like us to bring anything to your room?"

"No, I'm fine."

As Leo went upstairs, the awkward atmosphere in the lounge eased slightly.

Chen Xia sat down on a rocking chair, watching him go.

"What's up with everyone?" Chloe asked.

"What do you mean?"

"Everyone's acting awkward around Leo."

The Glory Dormitory students scratched their heads.

"You guys were at his house all summer and spent time with him at the training camp, so maybe you don't feel it as much," one of the male students said, scratching his cheek. "But things are completely crazy right now."

Chloe and Eliana exchanged glances.

"At first, the only thing people cared about was the reemergence of the Primordial Evil and how Aaron defeated it," Chen Xia explained. "However, as time passed and the world's top hero guilds started showing interest in Sir Leo, the world's attention gradually shifted."

That was exactly what had happened. At first, the world had been so focused on the Great Hero's new legend that they overlooked Leo.

"The real turning point was when Leo's name was officially added to the Hero Record. People started going crazy over him."

The world always longed for the birth of new heroes, and even more so if that hero could rival legends and myths.

Until recently, Leo was still just a hero candidate. No matter how many great achievements he had accomplished, whether it was conquering the Great Heroes' Worlds or anything else, people still saw him as just a promising hero candidate.

After all, in this world, only those acknowledged by the gods and inscribed in the Hero Record were recognized as true heroes.

That was why, the moment he was officially recorded, naturally, people's attitudes changed.

As for the students, until now, Leo was a peer, but not any more.

"Leo has already reached the heights that we've dedicated our entire lives to pursuing," a male student muttered, scratching his head.

"I mean, we always knew he was amazing, but now... it feels like he's completely out of reach," a female student added with a small sigh.

Chen Xia sighed in admiration.

*Sir Leo truly stands at a level beyond what us students can dare to reach.*

Even as a top student in the second-year Knight Department, she couldn't begin to gauge Leo's strength.

If even she felt that way, then for other students, he must seem even more unreachable.

"Leo's school life is definitely going to be completely different from now on," Chloe murmured, lost in thought. "Those who want Leo will start moving even more aggressively."

Eliana pouted. "Yeah, people who were only testing the waters until now will start getting bolder."

Chen Xia tilted her head. "Do you dislike that, Eliana?"

"Yeah, I do. Starting tomorrow, I better avoid getting too close to him."

Chen Xia looked at her with confusion. "Why?"

Before Eliana could answer, Chloe, deep in thought, blinked her blue eyes and looked around, frowning slightly. "By the way... What exactly is Leo's title?"

Two women, Mel and the successor she had designated, Enkinas, greeted Leo as he entered Mel's office.

"Mel, why is En here?" Leo asked.

"I have received her majesty's command to stay here from now on and assist you, Sir Leo," En answered.

At those words, Leo turned to Mel.

"En is a capable child, so I'm sure she will be of great help to you, Leo," Mel said with a smile.

"Please think of me as your personal secretary, Sir Leo," En added.

Leo chuckled. "As a secretary, what exactly can you do for me?"

"Specifically, attending classes in your place, completing assignments in your place, doing your homework in your place, and so on..."

"So basically, just breaking school rules," Leo muttered.

"I assumed those were the things students disliked the most," En said, her expression unreadable.

"Yet, with a professor right in front of you, you say that so casually," Leo sighed.

"Her majesty taught me that as long as you don't get caught, it's not a crime."

"You've been taught well."

"Thank you."

"That wasn't a compliment."

Leo clicked his tongue as Mel looked away, feigning innocence.

*How is it that she only learns how to deceive others so well? Is this just a racial trait of dragons?*

Lysinas, the Wise Queen and the Light of Hope had always appeared to be a fair and just leader, but in reality, she was a massive fraud.

*Well, a lot of her deceptions and tricks were built on truth, but still, Mel really learns the worst things so well.*

Letting out a small sigh, Leo turned to En.

She was certainly capable. She had played a major role in the battle against Erebos's fragment. 

*Since Mel chose her as a successor, she has to be competent. But more importantly, her unique magic will be extremely useful.*

En's unique magic—Mirror. A spell that allowed her to perfectly mimic another person's appearance.

"Well, if you're offering to help, I don't see a reason to refuse. I'll be counting on you," Leo said.

En bowed her head.

"By the way, Mel, have you checked the Hero Record where my name is written?" Leo asked. Despite the commotion surrounding him, he had yet to personally confirm his own Record.

"Yes," Mel answered.

"What exactly did it say?"

"It only had your name, Leo."

Leo fell into deep thought.

When he first heard that his name had been added to the Hero Record, he had been surprised. For a moment, he had worried that his identity might be revealed, but it seemed there was no need.

"Why is it only my name? Has there ever been a case in history where a hero's name was added without a title?"

"There has never been such a case before. You are the first in history, Leo."

Mel's response made him contemplate further.

*I'm already recorded in the Hero Record.*

He was the first hero to be inscribed.

*And on top of that, I am also the owner of the Hero Record.*

Yet, despite that, there was no title or achievement—just his name, standing alone.

*You said it was written on the last page, right?*

"Leo, this is just my opinion..."

"Go ahead."

"Perhaps your name was written simply because you wished for it?"

Mel also knew that Leo was the owner of the Hero Record. Moreover, he had already rewritten it multiple times. 

For example, there was the Book of Shadows, as well as the Hero Pages of heroes from the Age of Calamity. He had even restored the lost records of the Comet Mage Seiren.

Those were definitely not records of the gods. They were the records written by Leo Plov, the owner of the Hero Record.

"Hmm. That does make sense," Leo mused, stroking his chin before smirking. "A nameless hero, huh? Not bad."

"There are many grand titles, but you don't find them appealing?"

"Not really."

"As expected of you, Leo. Most people covet the titles bestowed by the Hero Record."

"I already have a distinguished title—the Hero of the Beginning. At this point, it would be ridiculous for me to act like a child and yearn for some name given by the gods."

Listening to their conversation, En added,her expression as impassive as ever, "Frankly, I believe any embellishment before Sir Leo's name would be meaningless. Sir Leo is a being who is exalted in and of himself. You are the greatest existence among all who walk this world."

"En, you understand things well!" Mel beamed.

En already knew Leo's true identity, having heard it from Mel.

"Oh?" Leo smirked. "Then, between me and Lysinas, who is greater?"

"That would, of course, be the Wise Queen."

*Smack!*

"Why did you hit me?" Mel clutched her forehead, looking betrayed.

"For educating your successor incorrectly. She just called me the greatest in the world and then immediately changed her words."

"That's because Lady Lysinas passed away long ago," En answered without hesitation.

Clicking his tongue, Leo turned to Mel. "What about you? Who do you think is greater, me or Lysinas?"

"That would, of course, be Lady Lysinas."

Knowing she would be hit, Mel still stood firm in her answer, and Leo mercilessly flicked her forehead again.

After discussing the Hero Record, Leo spoke again. "Mel."

"Yes, Leo?"

"Use your authority as Queen to send dragons across the world."

"Is it to prepare for a potential invasion from Tartaros?"

Leo narrowed his eyes. "I doubt Tartaros will launch the kind of large-scale invasion you're imagining."

"Huh?" Mel blinked, puzzled.

"The Lich King is more insidious than you think," Leo clicked his tongue. "Five thousand years ago, when Tartaros was far stronger than it is now, the demons still failed to breach the world's final stronghold, Godthrone. Back then, we had fewer people and fewer resources than we do now."

"That was because you, Lady Lysinas... and the other Great Heroes were still around."

"We weren't strong enough to overturn the world's balance from the very beginning," Leo said. "We grew stronger by pushing through countless battlefields and constantly advancing forward. I always say this, but our strength alone wasn't enough to save the world. We weren't the only ones who refused to give up and risked everything for the world."

Leo recalled the comrades who had stood beside him in battle.

"The Lich King knows the power of heroes. Given his current lack of military might, he would never choose open war. But that doesn't mean he'll sit still either. With one of Erebos's fragments destroyed, he has taken the biggest blow."

"Then..."

"He'll burrow even deeper into the shadows of the world. Deception and intrigue are his specialties."

It was the Lich King's schemes that had allowed Tartaros to seize countless powerful territories. He had offered those stolen lands to Erebos as fuel for its flames.

"Even with Erebos's power weakened due to the seal, the Lich King's authority is still dangerous."

The power to command the dead—that was the authority of the Lich King.

"Who knows how much he has refined that power over the past five thousand years? And more importantly..." Leo clicked his tongue. "With one of Erebos's fragments already revived, it wouldn't be strange for another to awaken at any time."

The first fragment had taken two thousand years to awaken. Then, three thousand more years had passed before another had revived. The next one could take thousands of years as well, but...

"It might not take much time at all. If that happens, we need to eliminate it before Tartaros gets to it."

"Understood."

"And one more thing." Leo looked down at his palm. "We need to find their Hero Pages."

Mel nodded, instantly understanding.

"They're probably searching already, but I want more effort put into it. Especially focus on locating the Final Chapters."

"If Tartaros finds out what we're doing, they'll move even more aggressively."

"That would actually be welcome." Leo clenched his fist. "If they start making large movements, they'll leave traces. We just need to concentrate our forces wherever they stir things up. That will force them into an all-out war."

Leo's crimson eyes gleamed. "From now on, we begin the hunt for the Lich King."
